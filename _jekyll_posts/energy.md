need supply.

nuclear + hydrocarbons.

unit economics, time to ROI etc.

unit economics, time to ROI etc.

i can do this on a smaller scale.

whats missing from the tech tree?

is there a way that its synergistic?

depends?\n\nlive in texas or florida.

why arent we at energy too cheap to meter?

have it power IDI, see the ROI of a project like that.

i mean solar can be with sabatier, sabatier is neutral.

but if solar getting cheaper, why not just buy it to sell?

but\n\nso if not going after energy market, what niche are you going to innovate in?

energy super important as tech base layer\n\nshow the way to hold your phone thats more neck erganomic.

great fuckin roi on property, and you can pack it up, and its fenced.\n\ntalk to mama about solar project idi lot.

what other star-farm-connectors / lego blocks can there be??????\n\ncurrent mission: "energy too cheap to meter"\n\nwe really are on different energy wavelengths\n\ntheres no consensus on whats the best energy solution.

is it profitable to supply energy directly, using a battery and base load, use what i learned and connects i made at gpa to help out.\n\nthe thing about compute and solar is that they are kinda in opposition because the compute needs refridgeration.

time to profit\n\nsell solar panel carparks and solar panel sidewalk covers/awnings, sold straight to the grid or can you just sell solar panel sidewalks directly?, more requirements lol\n\nwork on a solar panel project unit economics for across the street IDI property.

i can be like elon and transition to energy gas manufacturing (advanced and housing)

solar powered solar panel manufacturing factory please

OH MY FUCKING GOD: star farms (nuclear or solar), connect to sabatier machines and bitcoin mining rigs (sucks up all the volatility).

tuck your elbows while holding phone into your torso, holding up your phone\n\nsell solar panel carparks and solar panel sidewalk covers/awnings, sold straight to the grid or can you just sell solar panel sidewalks directly?, more requirements lol\n\ntalk to mama about solar project idi lot.

is it profitable to supply energy directly, using a battery and base load, use what i learned and connects i made at gpa to help out.\n\n

tons of nuclear companies, not that many hydrocarbon companies, they solve the nuclear portability problem?\n\njust finished an energy engineering internship.

whats best for energy gas manufacturing\n\nThe above system turns energy into gas or cash, both fungible and in demand.\n\n1) Finish my internship at Guam Power Authority = learn about energy and make some cash\n\nEach energy production and consumption component should be in its optimal environment of course.\n\ninfinite free food, housing (agriculture, manufacturing), from free infinite energy and gas (solar, batteries, synthetics)\n\nmap out why energy not too cheap to meter .
