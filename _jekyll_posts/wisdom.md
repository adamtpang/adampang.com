do you become more like the chair stark?

learn from the ancient myths and stories.

what is a good man but a bad man's teacher?

use leverage so your judgement is the real factor.

from great understanding\n\nvery few timeless things.

i think jordan doesnt see more into the future maybe.

smarts * wisdom\n\nmoney is for freedom not happiness.

i want both\n\nthe goal is input and output DISCONNECTED.

i wanna be like a buddha like that atla monk whos a goof.

something like that\n\nsourced people say things at a wisdom rate we cant believe.

like elon or deutsch naval balaji etc\n\nforgive them father for they do not know.

illuminate concepts for lost people then, and be open to being illuminated yourself.

illuminate concepts for lost people then, and be open to being illuminated yourself.

spend more time on the timeless and not the temporary\n\ndeutsch even weaves in dukkha.

but really theyre just at source and calling it how they see it, they just say what they see.

Iâ€™m not fundamentalist, but I also think dropping all this ancient wisdom is extremely foolish.

These ideas have actually stood the test of time.\n\na great life is built upon great decisions.

another instant of ancient wisdom later modernly verified*\n\nmoney is for freedom not happiness.

but its great that hes rescuing old knowledge and cherishing old wisdom\n\nive had a taste of source and i cant go back.

health wealth wisdom is more for peace, and calm mind fit body house of love\n\nlearn from the ancient myths and stories.

this is ancient daoist wisdom: what is a bad man but a good mans job?\n\nyou can fail at reaching a goal, but also a goal may be a mistake in itself lol.

wisdom seems to me to be about wanting the right things in the first place "pick the right door before "locking in""\n\nNow, I think we have to differentiate what to hold onto and what to drop from all these ancient belief systems.

health wealth wisdom is more for peace, and calm mind fit body house of love\n\nwrite about how i like the serenity prayer, its all encompassing, grounding, its part stoic, part agency-encouraging, part wisdom\n\nthe best are great teachers and great students.

this is ancient daoist wisdom: what is a bad man but a good mans job?\n\nwisdom comes from experience and reflection and an ever nuanced decision tree, marked by kunai where you can teleport from anywhere to anywhere like 4th hokage with compressed truths, meanings, directives\n\ninfluence can be seen as old artists are trendy but still are listened to like the foundations of the canon like the bible.

humor has truths too its all about transformative truths affecting things beyond you, the illusion of seperate self, health wealth wisdom, maslows, markets, explanations, riffing, generate curate elevate\n\n

on Feb 2, 2025 at 11:00 AM - 11:30 AM\n\nThe Closer You Are to the Truth, the More Silent You Become Inside + the closer you are to source, the less memorization needed\n\nforgive them father for they do not know.
