# Why I'm Going Back to School (But Not the One You Think)

*How I accidentally discovered the future of education while dropping out of the past*

## The Great Unbundling

I've spent the last few years watching the slow-motion collapse of traditional education, and honestly? It's about time.

University has become a luxury brand masquerading as a necessity. A degree is increasingly just a status symbol—universities are talent aggregators that charge premium prices for what amounts to expensive babysitting and credentialing. The lie of higher education is in its unanimity: everyone pretends it's essential while deep down knowing it's largely BS.

But here's the thing about unbundling: something better usually emerges from the pieces.

## Enter the Network School

I'm writing this from Singapore, where I'm attending the Network School—and it feels like I've accidentally stumbled into the future. This isn't just another "alternative to college." It's what happens when you rebuild education from first principles.

The Network School solves the fundamental problem of educational cost while encouraging talent from around the world. It's like a modern version of the Ancient Greek Lyceum—education that doesn't just teach you how to think, but incorporates physical fitness, practical skills, and real-world problem-solving.

We're not just students here; we're collectively writing the newest testament of how learning should work.

## The Bundling and Unbundling of Everything

Traditional universities bundle together:
- Social signaling (the degree)
- Knowledge transmission (lectures)
- Peer networks (classmates)
- Research access (libraries, labs)
- Credentialing (grades, transcripts)
- Coming-of-age rituals (college experience)

But most of these can be done better separately. You can learn from the internet, build peer networks through communities, signal competence through proof of work, and access research through open sources.

The magic happens when you re-bundle only the best parts: curated peer networks, mentorship from practitioners, project-based learning, and real-world problem-solving.

## Philosophy and Wealth Creation for the New Age

If I were designing curriculum for the new age, philosophy and wealth creation theory would be at the top of the list. These are the fundamental skills:
- **Reading, writing, arithmetic** (the classics)
- **Persuasion and programming** (the new literacies)
- **First principles thinking** (navigating unprecedented problems)
- **Wealth creation principles** (permissionless leverage and value creation)

The best areas to learn are the frontiers—where there's no map and you need correct axioms to derive first-principles solutions.

## Teaching to the Problem, Not the Tool

Elon was right: schools got it backward. They teach the tool instead of teaching to the problem. Math becomes relevant when it's actually relevant—when it comes into play for your mechanical engineering project, not when it's abstract homework.

This is why flow and learning come from relevance. Clear goals, immediate feedback, and the right balance of challenge to skills. Most traditional education violates all of these principles.

## The Talent Curation Problem

What the top universities do best is curate people. The real value isn't the education—it's being surrounded by other motivated, intelligent people. But this creates a chicken-and-egg problem: how do you bootstrap a new institution without the reputation that attracts talent?

The Network School's approach is elegant: start with a clear mission, attract mission-aligned people, and prove value through results rather than credentials. It's talent curation based on demonstrated competence rather than test scores and essays.

## Modular, Stackable Education

The future is modular education with intensive microcredentials and proof of work for concentrated skills. Why spend four years getting a broad liberal arts education when you could:
- Learn specific skills as needed
- Stack credentials from multiple sources
- Update your knowledge continuously
- Get paid while learning (apprenticeships/internships)

Companies are already becoming schools that pay you. The question is whether traditional institutions will adapt or become irrelevant.

## The Academy, Gymnasium, and Shrine

Ancient Greeks understood something we forgot: education isn't just intellectual. The ideal educational environment combines:
- **The Academy** (intellectual discourse and learning)
- **The Gymnasium** (physical fitness and competition)
- **The Shrine** (meaning-making and wisdom traditions)

The Network School is attempting this integration. We code together, work out together, discuss philosophy together, and build real projects together. It's education as it should be: holistic and practical.

## Why I'm Here to Learn

I wanted to go to Stanford growing up. Now I'm going to what feels like the next evolution. I'm here because:
- I love school now (but only when it's done right)
- Free is overpriced when it doesn't work
- I hunger and thirst for real learning
- I want to solve problems in a positive-sum way
- I'm building the school I always wanted to attend

## The Great Transition

We're in a transition period where there's no set way to approach meaning-making, learning, wealth creation, or even dating. The old institutions are failing, but the new ones are still being built.

Network schools and eventually network states represent one path forward. Not the only path, but a promising one. It's about creating new institutions that preserve what worked about the old ones while discarding what didn't.

As we collectively write this newest testament, I'm optimistic. Not because the future is certain, but because we're finally building alternatives that put learning, competence, and human flourishing at the center.

*The burden of understanding is on the teacher, not the student. And finally, we're building schools that understand this.*
