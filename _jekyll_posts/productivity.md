clear goals, immediate feedback, challenge skills balance

scaling down the task so perfectionism is easy to beat.

like a half blood prince notebook for others a cheatsheet

positive constraints

curation makes it easier to sift.

clear goals, immediate feedback, challenge-skills balance

build the lever to then pull

i like a clear clarity plan.

go for volume and speed and relevance, edit later

writing and talking must be complements to action, not substitues.

maybe writing online in markdown aint a good idea idk:

find a better way for markdown formatting and line break stuff.

leverage is anything where 1 decision actuates without you

getting a job is permissioned

it was one of the first apps i made when learning how to code and ive been using it for 2-3 years now so i know that i find it valuable.

but if no example, you gotta do the first principles calculus to be sure of the solution derivation

if you dont wanna do it, dont do it.

moral of the story: stop adding shit to your plate that isnt worthy on Apr 23, 2025 at 11:45 AM - 12:15 noon\n\nhelps with procrastination.

pandoc should do better

show the chrome extensions i use

check if pandoc can do links and pics

if i add pics to markdown, will that work?

nah

my productivity workflow, dont trust me

sometimes its simply a lack of procedural knowledge

talk about sabatier, link to casey and s3.

blueprint should have a spreadsheet with all interventions and costs, then we can sort by cost and you can do it on whatever budget youre on.

(give customizability options of each module and each button), then it goes straight into your gcal, finds open spaces (set your parameters).

generate curate excavate,

immediate relevance is great for flow

with any creation like code or media, make it super easy to do, for yourself.

find a team or make one


it should look delusional on the surface, but if you have gotten through the first principles idea maze, youre golden.

the inaction cost is too high, you must say yes.\n\nchange hower.app to 8020.best, then the headline should be "cut away 80, focus on your best 20.

the social context matters so much psychologically

consolidate files / posts

i see things in pipelines, like supply chains / logistics / bottlenecks.

map out the connections between them all

comparrow all the blog post titles, then

write a what to work on roadmap:
important problems, solutions, team.

Minimize Distractions: Derek’s advice to simplify means only taking on freelance gigs or day jobs if they are directly aligned with your long-term goals.

but also 8020 analyze

lets write first but
what is are the criteria for how ill edit each node, or delete nodes, and ill just add nodes, do i categorize them?

redo comparrow and sell on store

not the input of work, what is the output of the work, and own the solution of that output, to solving a problem you identify.

Financial Discipline: Pay down your debt following Dave Ramsey’s baby steps, but don’t let the need for immediate cash flow deter you from pursuing high-growth opportunities.

if i can ignore the solution, its not a problem

fearset shit: define prevent repair base hit inaction cost

if someone has done it, you know from 1st principles its possible.

scapple this

Putting it All Together
Prioritize Scalable Ventures: Focus on building the blog and indie hacking store, as these offer scalability and align with Naval’s advice on permissionless leverage.

question delete\n\ndamn it can be so hard to get output, execution, ideas are so easy in retrospect\n\nkeep a clean feed, a clean calendar, a clean diet, a clean house, a clean codebase\n\npriority cal 2.

but quality THROUGH quantity

just focus on volume rn, dont edit, just post

i can always transfer content to wherever else

color code quality

talk about my productivity system

right now just post a ton.

if you have good reason to know this will work, and you have a mission and you know what variables to manipulate to achieve your goal state

so ill only focus on code and media till i have the money i want?

working hard costs more energy and stress and time, its all about allocation to the invisible calculus

solve problems, own the solution, leave a trail of leveraged solutions

whats the simple elegant solution?

then you can use this upcoming calendar tool that will automatically import these tasks into your (let users choose 11s alone or also include 10s, also let them consolidate duplicate tasks, and they quickly sequence.

just do more with less


the fastest way to do something is to not do it at all

its gotta click in my mind

Tips for Using Markdown
Headings: Use # for main titles and ## or ### for subheadings.

you will die with a todo list\n\nrun all todos through 8020best and caldump and do that consolidate sonnet thing, after i finish whats on my plate on calendar on Jun 14, 2025 at 7:00 AM - 7:30 AM\n\nwork on nsradio feature?

figure out the jekyll thing

ethical productive incentive design from the beginning, im realizing, is super important in certain areas

curation is where choice is easier

give me the cheatsheet

could this bite me in the butt?

add relevant emojis to each title, shorten titles

fulfill social commitments: JR and aydin gokce, then meta commitments from keeps

if you can ignore the solution, it wasnt a real problem

unfinished projects are like unfinished books.

you filter ideas you have (i take tons of notes), by importance and urgency, just like president eisenhower did in war, and i find 50%-90% of my tasks are filtered out, and youre left with the 20% of tasks that are actually worth doing.

8020 thisto do list 2, 8020 this with claudeto do list 3 8020 this with claude.\n\nblog post about my daily routine and productivity flow, show comparrow, then make the google calendar integration\n\nbe OUTPUT focused, NOT input focused.

give example of recent cal tasks, show my productivity funnel: notes, comparrow (digital store link to it, make it super simple and easy to buy), calendar.\n\nafter notecal.ai, send out with gummy search to all productivity reddits / influencers.

i like discipline and diligence over the long haul, project management and cooperating with your past present and future selves, over time, with different frames and frame breaks, when discipline makes sense, youll know deep down

so the daily game is.

maybe working hard is lazy in a way, because if theres lack of clarity, youre compensating with "hard work" which is socially acceptable

mwahaha iykyk

here's my daily process:

1) i write tons of new ideas in google keeps

2) i have a note with my routine in it:

- delete stuff

- coffee

- make sure i get protein + veggies

- IF whoop green: exercise (see "sports" post)

- clear calendar as much as I can JUST for today

- double inhales (check andrew huberman)

- serenity prayer

- comparrow (an eisenhower matrix app i made) (will appear in my digital store eventually)

3) so the TLDR for the whole process is: notes -> comparrow -> calendar -> then i just do the stuffs
