like when 3rd gen aged out?

concerts, ads, sponsorships.

did people just get over the trend?

nostalgia overload

2nd gen and early 3rd gen.

the big names like bts BP twice getting older?

starting senior year of high school, for the next 3-4 years I was obsessed

in 2024, its not the same

why though?

i mean maybe, the hardcore fans are still there, but i feel like kpop fans are very age dependent, like its a kid-teen-young adult kind of thing

do you grow out of it?

idk

the economics of it dont seem too good idk, it seems really hard to have a long lasting way to capture people's attention and monetize it

i mean how do they make money?

for sure they do make money, but kpop as a part of the zeitgeist i think naturally comes in waves, and its a very generational thing

i remember watching all TWICE MVs, going through LOONA in order, good times.
