+ pain is plasticity.

humans are innately social so...

its social proof that i can be with people and they like me.

i think there are laws of physics and laws of people







...

i need more friends so i can go to shit with friends and not look like a loner.

+ a plasticity visualization\n\n

balaji and network states, new laws for nuclear...

yes still responsible, but because of the pain, they have the opportunity to change and learn.

- errors are the gate to plasticity\n\nim learning the laws of physics, laws of wealth, laws of sex\n\nproperty rights, law and order, minimum effetive governance and best kpis\n\nthe more they actually change for the better, the less they deserve to be punished for past mistakes.
