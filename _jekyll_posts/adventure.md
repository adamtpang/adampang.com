# Life as Adventure: Notes from the Edge

*Raw thoughts from someone learning to live fully*

## The Game of Life

Life really is like an MMORPG. You spawn somewhere random, you level up your skills, you find your crew, and you go on quests. The difference is there's no respawn—this is hardcore mode.

I've been thinking about this a lot lately, especially after spending time at Network School in Malaysia. When you're surrounded by people from 100+ countries, all working on different projects, it hits you: we're all playing the same game, just with different strategies.

## The Adventure Mindset

Adventure isn't just about traveling or extreme sports. It's about approaching life with curiosity instead of fear. It's about asking "what if?" instead of "what's safe?"

Some thoughts I've been collecting:

- **Death is a one-way door** - so we might as well see what we can make of this one life
- **The biggest risk is taking no risk** - especially when you're young
- **Flow is optimal** - when thought connects directly to action, like surfing or soccer
- **Create, don't just consume** - make things that didn't exist before

## From Guam to the World

Growing up on Guam, I felt trapped by geography. 1/8 million people on an island. But the internet changed everything. Now I can collaborate with people everywhere, learn from the best minds, and contribute to projects that matter.

The trick is being "internet-first" - build online, then meet offline. Find your tribe through your work, not your zip code.

## Experiments in Living

I'm trying to approach life like a series of experiments:

- **100 songs** to learn music production
- **100 apps** to understand building things people want
- **100 conversations** with interesting people
- **Soccer, BJJ, rock climbing** - different ways to use your body
- **Psychedelics, meditation, cold plunges** - different ways to expand your mind

The pattern is always the same: try something small, see what resonates, then go deeper on the things that work.

## The Network State Experience

Living at Network School has been like adult summer camp for builders. Everyone's working on something—apps, startups, art projects, research. The energy is infectious.

What I've learned: your environment shapes you more than you realize. Surround yourself with people doing things you want to do, and you'll naturally level up.

## On Meaning and Play

I used to think you had to choose between being serious about life or having fun. Now I think the best approach is treating life like a game you're genuinely excited to play.

Games have:
- Clear objectives
- Immediate feedback
- Increasing difficulty
- Social elements
- A sense of progression

Life can have all of these too, if you frame it right.

## The Long Game

I'm 22. If I live to 100, I have 78 years left. That's enough time for multiple careers, multiple identities, multiple adventures. The question isn't "what should I do with my life?" It's "what should I do first?"

Right now I'm focused on:
1. Getting out of debt
2. Building things people want
3. Finding my tribe
4. Staying healthy and growing

Everything else is details.

## Notes to Self

Some reminders I keep coming back to:

- Never forget what you saw in Singapore (the possibility, the energy)
- Physical over digital when possible
- Help others win, not just yourself
- Document the journey - you'll want to remember this
- Stay open to serendipity
- Trust your curiosity over other people's expectations

## What's Next?

I don't know exactly where this path leads, and that's the point. Adventure means heading toward the unknown with good principles and an open mind.

If you're reading this and feeling stuck, try one small experiment. Book a flight somewhere. Start a project. Message someone you admire. The treasure you seek is in the cave you fear to enter.

The game is on. Let's see how far we can go.
