why?

humanoids?

just flow.

- just feel.

just one rep?

accountability.

- can you do 1?

problem-solving.

- dial up coding.

you get the point.

specific knowledge.

leverage (scalable).

lemme max out both first.

lemme max out both first.

building relationships at scale?

yes its permissionless leverage.

yes its permissionless leverage.

accountability (no competition).

anything else besides code and media?

anything else besides code and media?

code is rarer\n\ncode and media maxxing.

im getting leverage the permissionless way.

idk what the new forms of leverage will be...

problems solutions communities marketing sales.

hate it, gonna go side door, circumvent this shit.

build leverage, then 1 buy button moves mountains.

code is rarer\n\npoint your leverage to each other.

low supply (specific knowledge), high demand (top problems).

- what who where - what would this look like if it were easy?

tiny inputs and colossal outputs are real in this day and age.

being embarassing online isnt the goal, but im willing to right?

the world will open up to me\n\nwith gatekeeper after gatekeeper.

judgement is choosing the right buttons, the right dominos, and why.

the age of infinite leverage\n\n- permissionless code and media leverage.

- ideally, make money with just your mind, leverage does ALL the heavy lifting.

im considering it for permissionless leverage\n\nwith gatekeeper after gatekeeper.

building leverage around what?\n\nmy history with gatekeeprs and permissioned stuffs.

BUT you need to actually solve people's problems to provide value to your fellow human.

its just anything where judgement is a lever so it works while youre not attending to it.

be do have.\n\neven a bit of value online can scale to the size of the internet, which is growing.

and with media, that builds a reputation and trust with people (so called audience)\n\nleverage is a force multipler.

as a funny analogy, there are people in the world that can push 1 button, say 1 word, and a nuke across the world can be sent and blow up a city.

brick by brick leverage.\n\na body of work of leverage allows for both reach and parasocial depth\n\nwork on the wealth setup, the love setup, the leverage, where ill have options.

leverage.\n\ni think naval is right, with leverage you can “outwork”, but its gotta be pointed in the right direction\n\nwhen your hire or delegate to machine, you buy or program another entities time, spreading out substance and reach using leverage\n\nif youre gonna become famous, have it be for doing what you do, not because you WANT TO.

- "time carries the weight."\n\nuse a lever or be a lever: doesnt need to be all humans btw\n\nindiehacking fits in navals permissionless leverage wealth creation explanatory framework\n\n

that is basically labor leverage, like 3d printers gen fab\n\nPrioritize Scalable Ventures: Focus on building the blog and indie hacking store, as these offer scalability and align with Naval’s advice on permissionless leverage.\n\nare there more leverage ways than labor capital code and media?
