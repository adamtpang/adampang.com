brain software is collective belief of the superorganism

how does geo-arbitrage work?

consolidate, like bring links out to the main page, less clicks, but more overwhelm...

im so sorry for those people i asked in neediness, like kasra, bruno, judah hyperdata.

as long as someone else has made a similar decision, you could chalk it up to mimesis.

so the 3 constituants of flow aint a bad place to start

is violence needed for curation or is mere economics a good enough curator of genetics?

dont do unnecessary stuffs but when something you know you gotta do, and can do, do it.

BUT you need to actually solve people's problems to provide value to your fellow human.

put a pic of me on personal site

reverse engineer why X person, doing Y thing, worked.

i like it when tech is tied to ethics, i can get behind that

what is a mistake anyway?

plan learn build show tell

i couldn't find a job so i made some

why do we want money?

talk about foundational tech like energy gas manufacturing

vice signalling.

if its clearly a good decision, fully aligned, its just courage you need, nothing more.

check if pandoc can do links and pics

put why i like each exemplar, why i admire them.

the universe is 13 billion years old, humans live 85 years or so, so we are like FLOPs?

thiel says psychology is a poor substitute for religion

Jesus is the ultimate scapegoat?

like how ill play badminton cause its a novel exercise, its social, and its good IG fuel.

its just anything where judgement is a lever so it works while youre not attending to it.

even if something is hard, if it energizes me, go do that

who are your mentors' mentors?

my posts will get more nuanced over time, itll get cleaned up, noise will turn to signal.

i dont need to know all details, but if i understand fundamentals, i can always rederive.

hes like peterson without the anger

not in kind but in degree

it is not the end of history.

im learning truths stronger than my previous beliefs, and the vision is not exactly positive.

pain is plasticity, going deeper into the training of the neural net, backprop, forward prop.

talk about how code and media is leverage, where even with a small value add, it scales mega.

links in an essay give an otherwise 2d thing 3d, it has depth when you can go INTO the words.

change is upon us

will something rather than nothing


karl popper got falsifiability so right.

as long as you reach the a-s tier, no need to worry about rank if you fall into the good bucket.

post my teachers teachers

therapy

wanting people to like me

talking or learning without action is cowardice

cowardice as morality.

essay on star farms, network states, sabatier machines, and bitcoin mining

can i even find guys i like / wanna be friends with?

if i was running a show, id want to plan the whole thing out, then actually manifest it with clear vision, and to not get bored, id do a ton of em

what else could we know, us, the superorganism, an offshoot of life

maths is relevant WHEN its relevant, when it comes into play for your mechanical engineering project

one of the sucky things about atoms is that you need cash to get started for the audacious projects, not tryna make excuses, just noting the difference between bits.

Network States and Digital Citizenship
Network States: New forms of governance and community organization that operate on blockchain principles, with potential applications in citizenship, law, and infrastructure (e.g., Balaji Srinivasan's concept of network states).

hard work is not a sufficient variable for financial success

i respect atom-entrepreneurs fosho, i just wanted to build leverage first.

friends can setup dates thats so cool

think about you, then your parents, and then their parents, all the way back to the first liforms on earth.

the most contrarian thing of all is to think for yourself, not to merely oppose the crowd

life is trades

as long as i get the macros right, i can eat the micros

i dont get why the weeknd is #1 on spotify

23:24 Raising capital is seen as a way to run experiments that can't be done without it; founders should first exhaust all possible low-cost experiments.

its our time, you are a part of this huge thing called life

say i used to jailbreak everyones iphones in highschool with cydia, ran a small candy arbitrage business, made 20 bucks a day

when you learn the fundamentals of a system, you can rederive solutions from the ground up

self driving is great for kid dropoff pickup, no need to own


debt can be better than equity???

like blackbeard, double power, double pain

show routine:

never ship, never know

one of the great thing about travel is that people dont have expectations of you, you can be as tabula rasa societally as you can

if you get to the essence, you can have conviction as long as you got the axioms right, you can rederive life solutions

instead of "phone, say text" add telegram?

deviation selection

clear conscience priceless

talk about soccer and fifa and soundtracks

young people on twitter i think are going somewhere: luke farritor, aydin gokce

talk about the 100 tweets experiment

for 50 bucks, ill help you:
- get your name domain
- setup a simple website
- teach you how to interact with it and change it

pain is plasticity

if not this, then what?

here's how i plan to format this blog:

1) keep blog posts informal (low stakes for me) (code-wise, i made it super easy for me to CRUD these posts)

2) 1 page max (creative constraint)

if there's jargon, I apologize, but I'm kinda writing half for myself, half to build relationships online, albeit parasocial and 1-sided

i'm embracing imperfection and going for speed and volume.

with every technological breakthrough, ask what the implications are, how is this relevant to YOU?

talk about addiction

women are mimietic in sesiring men

mimesis is fine as long as you think independently on what matters esp

power law shape

if you could hear a little voice in your head that tells you exactly the right choice to make in every decision, with all variables considered, would you always listen to it?

not allowed to use the backspace key (in general)

are there too many blog posts: then delete
are there too many words in a blog post: then clean up

i like when i get super into something, life breaks my frame, then i see it was foolish or thats not where i should focus/allocate attention

blind: nothing
serendipity: location, code and media
detection: learning, axioms + rederivation
attraction: combinatoric skills knowledge connections location

someones music, the books they read, the people they follow on X, what they watch on youtube, says a lot, their favorite movies

solving lifees equations

i like figuring out the microeconomics of projects because i does nt lie, and implications excite

damn, the beatles are like if you had 2 bob-dylan level songwriters in 1 coallition, and then a slumbering giant of george on top of it, with the vibes of ringo that matched the band.

just focus on volume rn, dont edit, just post


i mean i wanna do like what elon did and get wealthy with code (permissionless leverage like naval says, along with media to build relationships at scale, like david senra pointed out), then i can work in the atom-tech thats foundational like energy gas manufacturing housing



talk about my favorite kpop idols

maybe when a blog post gets too long, i can break it up into subparts and link to each

talk about being from guam and its career challenges, maybe its a good constraint because i really focus on code and media because of it


talk about going to therapy, talking needs to be a compliment to action, not a substitute, from thiel's recent talk with joe rogan

what other leverage is there?

i want to earn just enough that its higher than my burn (+800$), but i really want time for code and media
