Projects are bottoms up memes.

founding is a method, not a goal.

startuo idea?\n\n- launch and talk to users.

say go to my companyâ€™s presale page and tell em how itll work.

be empathetic and ask\n\nvisa and indiehackers are about volumism.

and whats the bottleneck to actually seeing the first network state?

like cavemen wouldnt buy cryosleep, even though thats fuckin awesome.

i think the idea DOES matter, and i think you can do IO mag tracking.

detect quality then go for quantity, but also presentation on my part.

"i never knew i needed this!"\n\nget network school network state merch.

just like quality > quantity


the good thing is that i get my time back.

youll know when the post blows up.\n\nmake 8020best and caldump freemium?

ok so what?\n\nwould you travel here if you couldnt take pics and post on ig?

put an ideasbugs button on the bottom right of every startup so i get feedback.

real friends, owning a real\n\ntalk about how its okay to start with zip2 first.

explanations reach infinity and we can build out our explanations along vectors.

nail the product, make sure 10 people LOVE it, then word of mouth will spread it.

do things that dont scale then scale.\n\nmake sift.best and market it and sell it.

elon says delete and question requirements\n\nuse link for cc details on my startups.

problem solving product matters most, and minimum effective marketing is how you sell it.

the top 50% is competent, which makes cofounders easy*\n\nwith startups: will this matter?

its like do you work on the foundational layer of the stack (energy gas manufacturing) first?

but you can also have the knowledge and have a principled successful startip on the first go.

and hes a counterexample, he doesnt sell shovels like marc lou as his highest earning product.

maybe nail hower first and fundraise idk.\n\n

because females do and should peel from the top.

over time

also remember that elon didnt start on zip2 till he was 24

business is the new war?

you need dry tinder kindling wood, you need the right conditions of no wind, low humidity, etc.

market every startup like: hower: be 10x more productive\n\nif users are promoting, dont promote.

as long as CAC < CLV, youre cherry

would you travel here if you couldnt take pics and post on ig?

market every startup like: hower: be 10x more productive\n\ni just have so many startup ideas now.

also do the x days since last updated, for all pages???\n\nsend mama startup links when theyre live.

"i never knew i needed this!"\n\nframe the indiehacking studio like an indiemusic production studio.

i wanna pay bills\n\nask 1 awesome friendly ambitious nerd from internet to work on scorecard.social.

the reason i think is because status along any axis helps males and females know who to reproduce is.

etcw\n\nwhen i get product market fit, insert sivers hell yeah i need this vid, THEN rebuild relaunch.

basically ways to literally make the world a better place even though thats a fake internal motivation.

first find who has the problem in the first place\n\ndo waitlists on landing pages to gauge market risk?

adamtpang..\n\nstartups are like building a fire, you need different things at different stages of the fire.

founder product market fit\n\nwork for an early startup teaches you from the inside.\n\nProjects vs startups.

and you need the skill or explanations to traverse each part.\n\n- what are the coolest companies to work for?

(housing is a good target)

and regulation comes into play, which highlights the importance of the network state.

startups dont have to be just bits of course, can and should be increasingly atoms-based, and also bio-based

...

every upgrade with 1 startup brings improvements to the rest\n\nhow to get first users without feeling bothersome?

and then really nail it until you cant improve without more feedback.\n\nif i wasnt successful you wouldnt like me.

do things that dont scale, manually pick good user targets and theyll actualy be glad to try to solve their problem.

etc\n\ncollege for entrepreneurship: y combinator\n\nstartups as 1 main critical feature is cool\n\nget a startup job.

clear goals, immediate feedback, challenge-skills balance, sustainable living

the right audience, not  a big audience.

rebuild, relaunch till first internet monies, and communicate with users, see what they think.\n\nnail it before scale it.

steve jobs was sourced, people who have a great pulse on source, source being/consciousness\n\nare you a happy user or no?

if you are building what already exists, are you just going to undercut?\n\nmake an ig post with lets get down to business?

please help support, youll get the product for the price you choose, and ill know you were an early supporter = future benefits.

for every person you refer (give a person by person promo code) and i verify a purchase, they get half of the revenue, for example.

prob dm blake anderson first though and zach on Feb 9, 2025 at 3:30 PM - 4:00 PM\n\nmake that project corwdfunding platform for ns.

maybe the idea is good but not the right time, the cost curve of the expenses are too great for it to plug into the current markets.

a buy me a coffee tip jar for an nft that can unlock new benefits later like a coupon code itll get you discounts for early support.

a buy me a coffee tip jar for an nft that can unlock new benefits later like a coupon code itll get you discounts for early support.

id have to find where the relevant people are, then show them the change they seek to make, i provide, for a cost (my pricing algo).

now its photoai.\n\nimagine if i could wave a wand and all my internet startup ideas were done being coded and ready to meet the market.

my own business, then gundo and energy gas manufacturing

life and entrepreneurship is problem solving

with every ai tool, theres an api cost.

when i launch, THEN ill know if there is PMF\n\nns internal phantom wallet kickstarter, with skin in the game, you get your name on the whatever.

because internet speed just hits differently?\n\nstartup ideas lie in your routine, the causes of death, and your monthly burn\n\n0 2 1, then 1 2 n.

people get rewards for more contribution, learn from kickstarter, and the earlier the better rewards etc\n\nfor my startups have a referral program.

founder product market fit\n\nput a Love and Respect page on every startup landing page for testimonials preselection like Love and Respect superteam.

yeah question delete\n\nfilter my startup ideas through the pieter thiel lens but also with an indiehacking lens\n\nmake rating gantry a stats site too?

every upgrade with 1 startup brings improvements to the rest\n\nan attractive woman is one of the most signally ways to show status that a man can have.

thats why orion also talks about contextual alphas.\n\nstartups fail because they lack knowlesge and are experimenting to find out knowlesge on the fly.

make it easy for them to tell me whats wrong or what could be better, am i hitting the target yaknow?\n\nmake an ig post with lets get down to business?

you couldn't just start building nuclear plants or whatever, you'd have to start with the constituant parts: metal etc

important and urgent

leverage on value


code and media transformations to capital and that to less stress, then to labor, and the code is also equity in.

visible competence and alex graceboxes and fame via visible competence..\n\nstartup ideas are on the sorted cause of death list and your monthly burn list.

do things that dont scale\n\nwhen i release my first startup on my bio do 1/100 startups: adampang.com/shop\n\nput "name a fair price" for all my startups.

if you were a caveman, and you had your tribe, and the goal was to, as fast as you could, replicate modern society in 2024, how would you go about doing it?

value add


PMF is escape velocity


generations of founders, like jon yongfook, pieter levels goat

im a founder

build something people want, talk to users.

anchormarianas?\n\nif the users STAY, THATS the product market fit sign, esp when the product sucks in the early stages\n\nuse link for cc details on my startups.

ai image of the idea, description, goal, milestones of what youll buy, project lead w name and contact, milestone goals like a mini kickstarter, with expiry date.

youll know when you have an amazing product on your hands.\n\nstartup ideas should pass filters, and if you can try to break the idea and it lasts, you gotta do it.

20% sales.\n\nMake something people want, launch fast, talk to users every day, and don't die.\n\n"talk to users, improve the product" product market fit is paramount.

yeah question delete\n\nstartup ideas are found in s tier books, your monthly burn, learning and noticing, what else?\n\nwho your cofounder is should be obvious, if not go solo.

the market is the people who have that problem, the product is the solution

entrepreneurship is just-in-time science

how would v1 companies you like look in your idea spreadsheet?

dm me\n\nstatus is baked into humanity, even if you play the most positive sum game, and youre the best positive sum game actor like elon, thats still a status axis and hes at the top.

these are great problem opportunities of wealth and life, literally.\n\nthe best startups both show you a postiive possibility that wasnt on your radar, and you are so glad to give em money lol.

logofamily like my ATP stick man idea\n\nbefore i announce my startups publically, find the 1-10 people who trust me already, who are willing to try, but they gotta be the people that im seeking to serve.

give it to them for half off idk: if this is not you please disregard this message.\n\non anchormarianas, show comparrow my first digital product of my company, and show presales and progress bars of my funnel.

maybe nail hower first and fundraise idk.\n\nevery problem in life is a startup opportunity, vet it\n\nthen get to 1 rep on each of the startup ideas that are good\n\nshow a spotify stock chart of artists in too 500.

there are good permissionless leverage reasons why starting with software before energy gas manufacturing can be a good decision.\n\ngo live in a hacker house in SF?\n\nstartups are like agar.io\n\nwhats your hamburg era?

just like elon, for diff transformations\n\nmake a company called banana: https://www.perplexity.ai/search/is-there-a-company-called-bana-1ZJ333.aQ3ujQ5Usz.22NQ\n\nthe cool thing about ns is that the talent pool is fairly good.

media and code

build permissionless levers

blog, made, store, podcast

how do i productize myself, i can be low supply with combinatorics and combinations with venns, but its gotta be aligned with the great problems of our time.

on anchormarianas highlight each startup and ideas in queue and their stats from my google sheet color coded\n\nthe best startups both show you a postiive possibility that wasnt on your radar, and you are so glad to give em money lol.

I see technology like a chain or stack

tech defined as "any better way of doing things

like imagine if you're a caveman, not many things are resources to you

david deutsch talks about transformations and knowledge, he's super relevant here

also.

explanations are potentioal and actions manifest em\n\nunlike internship and renting out time, if i can get from 0to1 on a project, it can scale to the size of the internet, which grows as a continent, and i have tons of ideas now thanks to the sg increased explanatory mental scaffolding, i even have more ideas.

idk..\n\nthen get to 1 rep on each of the startup ideas that are good\n\nthe ns bootcamp is basically learning how to work at a startup\n\nhuge problem, hypothesis, small prototype, small marketing, small sales.\n\nYeahh you can leave ns, change ns, or add more startup societies / locations\n\n1% founders and 99% investors?

ill finish this essay later lol its pretty deep with all the implications and rabbit holes i can go down

my plan is to go from Mongo to Gundo: meaning code and media, gain capital in a permissionless way, then place myself in a tech hub so i can work on energy gas and manufacturing (advanced and housing)

this housing thing ive been thinking of.

check the products i like\n\nfounder product market fit with code and media\n\nns fellowship is the new yc for ns for funding\n\nat ns, were trying to make blueboxes and zip2s\n\na startup is for building something you cant buy\n\nbegin with the problems in life for startup ideas.\n\nor get 1 customer, then ask for grants, do presales\n\nthere are hidden startup ideas in your monthly burn\n\nonly startup when you cant buy it, or 10x better way\n\nshould be 10x more YCs with the same tier of quality\n\nthere are startup ideas hidden in your monthly burn.\n\non all startups, minimal clicks to solve your problem\n\n"there are hidden startup ideas in your monthly burn"\n\nevery problem in life is a startup opportunity, vet it\n\ndo it out of love and fear.
