its cool when i see connections between my heroes:
friendly ambitious nerd (visa) = smart, hardworking, high-integrity (naval)

some things i like about my heroes is like theyre an expert on a topic, sometimes i admire how they are as just humans, their personalities

who are your heroes' hereos?

here are mine:

"people i mostly* admire"

who is doing code and media well: pieter levels, marc lou, jedcal

you can be raised on story heroes, sport heroes, musical heroes.\n\nimagine the new people that are coming online, new people being born, more life, more prosperity and meaning.\n\n

its whether I admire them / want to be more like them on some dimension OR they've taught me so much about life

Now here's what I've learned from each: (i'll try to keep it short)

I'll ben franklin rate them, and give 1-3 things that standout to me about what I've learned / what I admire
