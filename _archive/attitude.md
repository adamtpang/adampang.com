Try it smaller, and build your way back up, like a portfolio that totally dropped..\n\nit reminds me of freshman year where you take things super seriously, and then the next year you know whats up and chill out more, still determined but more at ease from familiarity i guess. im not as perfectionist. also i was trying to prove something, via competitiveness almost, now im just trying to live as best as i can. whatever that may mean\n\nit reminds me of freshman year where you take things super seriously, and then the next year you know whats up and chill out more, still determined but more at ease from familiarity i guess. im not as perfectionist. also i was trying to prove something, via competitiveness almost, now im just trying to live as best as i can. whatever that may mean\n\nthe fact that life can end and that life doesnt end, is insane. i want to fall in love w reality again. amor fati. not to merely bear existence, but to love it. im trying to escape, but ill die anyway? i dont have to exist, im choosing to. i dont want pity. i dont want to cry for help. i just wanna be better. this damn ego its hurting me? so much bullshit..\n\ndonavan was making a point about the only reason singapore can afford to be so beautiful on the inside is because of the masculine walls, the death penalty, strong borders. so only through outer strength can it afford to be inwardly good. i think this is a metaphor for people too. you gotta be strong and good. powerful and good. win maxxing and helping maxxing\n\ni want things to be perfect but thats not realistic. im not down about it, i just have learned to accept it. i had super high expectations of myself and the project, now i see it with clearer eyes i think. it will be a mixed bag, like most things, but we just keep going, operate on our best guesses with each situation, as it arises. what more can you do? haha..\n\nthe more i post, the more potential reason i give for people to unfollow. first of all i dont have to care about that. i do care about reaching people like me + live so you like you post. but the more people unfollow you, the more you know that the people who remain are the aligned ones for the long haul, for the infinite game. + polarize along authentic vectors.\n\nMemes and incentive. We think of each other as how they can help us solve our problems, we treat people like tools. Maybe its just me. But i dont want to think like that, i want to see the humanity in people, but its hard to do that for everyone. Maybe you only have so much room in your heart to care. Maybe this is where being selective matters. I feel hella lost\n\nFame half life. Im not famous but im afraid of it. I read tim ferriss essay on fame. Maybe its an excuse, a friend of mine said only good has happened as a result of his rise to micro-fame, there is a sweet spot of money and fame ive heard. Andrew wilkinson and tim ferriss. Seems like 7-8 figures is a sweet spot of money, 5 figures of internet presence is a sweet spot of fame.\n\nwhat i dont get about arjun and brett hall is that they shit on ideas they dont agree with, and theyre right about their stance, but thats not the way you get someone to be open to your better idea. better to begin with commonality, and bring the lower platocavemen to your position step by step. be a good teacher be a good student, this is what it means to be a good interlocutor\n\nthe biggest mistake you can make right now is beating yourself up. by dwelling you miss the opportunity. every mistake means a lack of knowledge, which means this is an opportunity to understand life and the world better. mistakes mean you are working at the edge of your knowledge, at your own personal frontier, which is flow-growth. this is not just trite wisdom, its actually true lol.\n\nwhat you want is the capacity to encounter, engage with, and solve new problems, with creativity. you want to keep your creativity engine in tact and fully functioning at its highest capacity, even if it means changing an otherwise fine system. dynamic is better than static, even if the static is working for now, if you are static, that is actually suicidal because of unknown unknowns and entropic problems that will come\n\n"i think i figured out life" "im back baby! only took me 30 days till the end of my 1 month vacation/break. i learned to have a healthier relationship to failure. coming to terms that i will always have imperfect knowledge, that some experiments will not go my way (farther from problem-goal states rather than closer), but as long as i always live out of my best understanding of things at the time, then i can forgive myself.\n\nwhen stuck in past, return to the present. we are not one, we are one. be your own father. forgive yourself. don't play by the rules, play WITH the rules. what would this look like if it were easy? perpetual break frame, reframe. pretend. the frustration makes it worse, like the adventure time calm bush. friendship art love. bet on what you influence. salt. questions -> answers. baby steps. articulation, action, baby steps. flow.\n\n- would your deathbed self regret this? - create curate. - live in jazz. - focus more on what you want to see more of. - clear goals, immediate feedback, challenge-skills balance. - there is no free lunch. - try slowing down, try to do the opposite of my extremeness. mama pointed out this bias. - don't be so all or nothing. what if i just do a little bit, each day? - BE a friendship-creator, a visibility-creator, a wealth-creator.\n\ni feel like once you become "successful" one of the main new goals is to not get disconnected from reality, you gotta keep a tight feedback loop with nature and markets, you cant get out of touch. what does successful mean? i think it depends on what the person wants? was hitler "successful" to him maybe. were his values and goals good values? no. so maybe he more objectively wasnt successful then. good values good goals good strategies.\n\nyou can "fail up" like whats his name. bugzy? buggy. you fail because you dont understannd reality, you forgive to soften the blow, the embarassment, you use humility to accept it. you use explanations to account for the failure, you then have an upgraded understanding of the world, of life, of yourself, then your next experiment/action is rooted in a better explanation than before. it's a life toolbox i've developed, to avoid despair, repair!\n\nsuccess. articulate 4 clarity. baby steps. fast. prolific. tasteful. the obstacle is the way. do not look around, look up. what look like if easy? Deutschian possibility. energy emotions buttons. what is influential? definite optimism. doubt no doubt. orchestration. 1 decision to cut away many. this is a test, a puzzle, an opportunity for virtue. do what you say, say what you do, build trust w yourself and others, be honest. true good beautiful.\n\nyou are not high enough to judge yourself. state story strategy. energy emotions buttons. follow the results you want. put the gun down. definite optimism. experiment. conviction. gratitude works, it just works. you shouldnt match bad chaos with bad order. if nothing changes, nothing changes. components; fast, prolific, tasteful. detach from outcomes, best inputs are all that stoically matter. how do i live the best life i can? you care too much.\n\nimagine when i have 1000 dollars in the bank, when i have people hitting me up daily to hang out both irl and url. when girls are DMing me daily wanting to hang out and they clearly like me. keep growing. solve these problems like a madman. be strong, be good. break down in scapple how exactly i plan to reach these goals and solve my top 3 problems. with energizers, friends and girlfriends that i genuinely like. on Feb 8, 2025 at 1:30 PM - 2:00 PM\n\nbe honest about what youre willing to give, "is it worth the cost?" https://youtu.be/URgncvVxxFU?si=KPAoBMaGGm-HOKR7 just being honest how you want to live your life. something to consider.. even the person who looks like a success on the outside, do they feel like a success on the inner scorecard? should you even "keep score" i think you cant really not do it, your mind automatically keeps score subconsciously, this is the peterson heirarchy nervous system thing..\n\n- what’s the salient error? let it lead the way. don’t despair, repair! - just do your best with available knowledge every day - all problems are solvable. dont despair, repair! this is the beginning of infinity! all your problems are solvable, you just don’t know how. but you CAN know how! - what would this look like if it were easy? actually answer this question :) - "does this actually matter?" - what labor capital media code am i creating curating today? to solve debt..\n\ni used to see people as y-intercepts, seeing them where they were, including myself, like thomas jefferson's meritocracy. now i'm practicing seeing people more like benjamin franklin did, where you see people's potential within them, you see what people COULD be, no matter where they are in that moment. it's like are you not gonna like babies cause they're CURRENTLY useless? or do you see the infinite potential within every person because that is truly the case, as far as i know.\n\ntrying to be perfect is a fools errand, obviously dont try to make mistakes but be willing to for the sake of progress. as long as youre net positive thats all that matters, try to maximize net positivity, nuanced utilitarianism. life is orchestration. putting out bad fires and lighting the right good fires. its like yin yang, theres always gonna be some yin in your yang, we are always wrong its just a question of how wrong we are. act in proportion to how wrong you are about something. tbd\n\nat first, i thought the answer was to push harder. "busyness is a form of laziness." it's indiscriminate action. it's silly to think you can do everything. sometimes, effort isn’t enough. sometimes, pausing and resting isn't enough. they go hand in hand — it's in their combination that problems get solved, not in just one or the other. it's both. you can brute-force your way to everything… or you can pause, upgrade your worldview to account for the errors made, and go again — but with a better head.\n\ni learned to accept infinite ignorance, to live out of best guesses of the true good beautiful in this life, and to forgive past failures due to that lack of knowledge (evils..) so moral judgements are from acting NOT out of good faith, and good faith living deserves forgiveness. i feel like a light beginner again. earnest. im learning to embrace the not knowing, the learning, the beginners mind sorta, not acting as much like i know how things work, cause i clearly dont. i feel like a mature kid haha\n\nput visible competence and preselection on IG. this will help convert girls to responding to my dms. and have a plan from message to sex. make a simple elegant plan that i can follow. from prethought plan from total understanding of how the system works. and clean the room minimalistic, and 8020 how to have great sex, a great relationship. and also focus on a genuine good social life. like with elijah, who else? choose dont chase. be honest. be strong. courageous. etc. on Feb 8, 2025 at 1:00 PM - 1:30 PM\n\nfollowing an account is turning on an attention stream. the question is what people / entities are worth paying attention to? are youu doing it out of pity or because you genuinely want to see more of them. id feel bad if i unfollowed my friend's account, it almost seems like im rejecting them. idk how to approach this. on one hand i want to keep my digital feed clean, on the other hand, i want to be honest about what people i admire and want to follow, and who i want to be friends with. its complicated!\n\n353 days left, after 6 months, 73 days.. unless mama renews "lease" say its like school, but cheaper and way better for me in the long run i swear with my whole being lol. be extremely you. need weekly play in my life like comedy improv. what would this look like if it were easy? do less, better.. problems are solvable. every obstacle is an opportunity for virtue. you are right here right now. infinity begins here and now. love it when past self saves your ass. what would this look like if it were easy? 1 8020 step a day..\n\nthere aint enough time to do all the ideas and projects. so you gotta prioritize. surround yourself with people that ship. quantity and quality of artistry. value creation value capture. after a certain amount of money, the only reason to get more money is to do bigger things. yeah ask yourself what youd spend it on. for me its debt, then savings, jnvestments, then projects and post economic shopping listZ then what? maybe use the ethical qualms about money to my advantage. if i can point it ethically. and win and help win, then we good.\n\nwhen youre faced with failure after failure, banging your head against the wall that just wont come down, it can start to feel impossible. and im not trying to be all hippy dippy positive, thats not good, but its a belief that it is in fact possible, its just that youre going about it wrong, evidently. theres still a gap between your theory of how it works, and how it ACTUALLY works, the truth. so of course don't give up if its worthwhile, continue to modify your theory and work for insights that can lend to a better more accurate experiment, next time..\n\nCrossing the sea of imperfection: try 1 then cureate, then 10, then curate, then 100, then curate, then 1000, then curate, then 10000, then curate. dont you want the net positivityy to be maximized? and create and curate. this is like the flood myth.. Theres a quote i like, and people with really good taste have such a high bar for the art that they never get started, but if you can aim for volume and edit later, you get asymptotically closer and closer to creating the food that will satisfy your taste.. Its like “fine! Be a perfectionist, but just LATER………”\n\nim realizing more and more as time goes on, that change really is the constant, as cliche as that is, bob dylan has that song "the times they are a changin", and yeah the old good things are sorely missed, but the good thing is that you can take advantage of leaving the bad and going toward the uptrend good, and being early. balaji has this great quip about "thiel's contrarianism" you dont want to be contrarian forever, you want to be contrarian early. you want to have seen the truth before others, positioned yourself well, then you reap the rewards of that rigor and curiosity\n\nim learning that im taking things way too fuckin fast. right? i mean im 22, obviously im not gonna try to waste my life but “time carries most of the weight” i will live to 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100, i just went from 0 to 10 to 20. ive been spending this time back home reflecting, and i think i need to ignore more in life, unlearn more, get rid of more. and really simplify and master. im so young and naive and stupid sometimes but im saying this in an optimistic spirit! theres so much i can get better at, so much to improve on. but im determined to get good at this game of life\n\nGOGGINS. do not look around to others, look up to God. never forget the deutschian lens. 90-10 solutions. if there is doubt, there is no doubt. the quest is right here. energy emotions buttons. energize or drain? choose really good lead dominos. not best, category of one. genius > talent for nonlinear returns. remove friction to get to your goals. create counterexamples, no bullshit. focus on positive change, not why current state is negative. learn earn or quit. generate curate excavate. even the best are molded out of faults. i want to see how great i can be. substance over status. competition is not validation\n\nwhen stuck in past, return to the present. we are not one, we are one. be your own father. forgive yourself. don't play by the rules, play WITH the rules. what would this look like if it were easy? perpetual break frame, reframe. pretend. the frustration makes it worse, like the adventure time calm bush. friendship art love. bet on what you influence. salt. questions -> answers. baby steps. articulation, action, baby steps. flow. think about the world and others more, exteroception, it's not just agent. the bad is next to the good. focus on your locus. well being is realized in small steps, but is no small thing. let admiration guide.\n\nim really growing a lot here. learning about myself, learning how to adapt to life's changes UGH i wanna throw up at that cliche speech but its true. maybe im just sucking my own dick about this situation because i have money from mama. im not dying rn. so i feel more at ease. i still need to remember that im in massive debt for my age. im 22 almost 23, my net worth is 9600 or so. thats terrible, im paying exorbitantly in credit card interest, so get steady income asap, what are my best guesses? code tasks + indiehacking better this time. building well selling well, then ask mama for debt jubilee. thats a great start. lets act now! lego....\n\nits almost like you are a flowing stream, and to solve a problem, you need that creative flowy water to get to a certain place. coercion and suppressing and forcing yourself is like using buckets to move the water from a to b, but actually its better to unblock the flow, so that the water more naturally, creatively, gets from a to b. its a better life strategy long term i think.. write about examples, like how i wanted to leave to go ground, but i also felt an obligation to stay at the table w the people, but i used an invitation to satisfy both inner desires that were in conflict, be the peacekeeper that is in my nature, but with myself lol\n\na corrected error is just as good as success, just with extra steps. and when you integrate what the last hill taught you, you don’t just try again — you try better. the quality of each attempt increases. but that's not enough. after making a bunch of mistakes, you’ve got to pause, upgrade your worldview — because the reason the errors occurred is that your worldview did not match the world. conjecture and criticize your worldview around that error until it can account for why it happened — and what you'd do differently if you were in that same scenario again (the moral of the story). THEN try again. aim for success — but know that you will fail again. embrace the inevitable.\n\nthe problem with "pussy thinking" goggins style mindsets / toxic masculinity, is that they are coercive, antirational, parasitic, beCAUSE, youre not allowed to question it, even though you are allowed to question everything, every thought, if you feel stuck in life, there might be "parasites" in your mind that overtly dont allow you to question them, like your mom, or your social taboo of a culture, like prostitution, social shame, etc. is there some law of the universe that you cant think about it, inspect it, question it? of course not, you can think and wrestle with every idea you want! it still may not be the right way, but you can actually inspect it, every stone is pickupable..\n\nthe fastest way to do something is to not do it at all. 20% effort, 80% benefit. statistics doesn't work with a sample size of 1. the obstacle is the way. if there is doubt, there is no doubt. articulate. memento mori, amor fati. accept 20% failure, wash away with excellence. clear goals, immediate feedback, challenge skills balance. what would this look like if it were easy? try rewarding yourself again. good shit. i stopped same time as goggins. i did the same with no caffeine + sleep. i gotta isolate variables and keep the baby, no bath water. fate leads the willing and drags along the reluctant. “Never confuse Motion with Action.” ― Benjamin Franklin, The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. substance, not time. i want to feel like i belong. never forget the deutschian lens. the good is next to the bad. of all bad things that bother me, what's the reverse good?\n\n- just solve problems. - if it does not break physics, it's possible. - have an inner scorecard. do your best, and that's all you can ask for. live so you like you first. - today is the beginning of infinity, never forget. - you could die today, let that determine what you do say and think. - create curate create curate. - don't tell me your ideas, show me your actions. - its the people stupid! - as long as you actually try your best, where is their room for regret? - meet new people, start new projects, don't overfocus on the old. explore the for you pages. - everyday, surf, jazz, roll. - balance extrinsic and intrinsic motivations. what do I genuinely just want to do? and play? = flow. - don't tell me what you know, show me what you practice. do i have habits that will bring me to the goal states of top problems? - if Elon maximizes thinking, Rubin maximizes feeling. - every no gets you closer to a yes. - try feeling more, thinking less. - be partial on purpose.\n\nIve been learning about procrastination, and ive been so negative framed, problem solving, it puts you in a negative frame, but i learned that to combat procrastination, it helps to have a positive framing. I recently was asked “what do you dream of?” and that was a hard question, it got a 404 for me.. And i think it has to do with that framing reality, that ive been always looking at how to subtract the negative, but maybe what im not doing enough of is adding, doubling down on the positive things that i notice, that im grateful for. Im grateful for my friends here at ns, like alborz, zoe, natalia, etc. even if i die, id like to have lived knowing that i helped my friends. People that i care about like maanasa and olena, people that have virtue i guess. I wanna know what the virtues are. Maybe this word vomit thing is an exercise in minimal backspacing, like a public morning pages. I tend to tangle myself up in knots, thats why i wanna get more psychedelics, because it helps to open the knottedness up, which helps me to untangle it. Yeah lets solve this. Okay cool good shit bye bye.. Yeah i dont wanna lose, but more than that, i wanna score, i wanna win.. Apply this mindset to life. Its not about “not dying” but “yes living”. It reminds me of soccer..\n\nWrite about fear: do what scares me: seek the dangerous yet transformative tests and truths. you can do it now, and itll be rough, but it will only grow and get worse if you dont. by dwelling, you miss the opportunity. there are limits to what you know, but you must be more than you are, so you must do what scares you, and be in the pool of THE unknown. you are scared because the possible results will show you possible truths that you dont want to see. why dont you want to see it? because it conflicts with your fragile identity that will have dissonance with the results of the experiment? it would not be an experiment if you would know the result, that would be more like replication. and you can copy in mimesis to the frontier, but once you encounter the frontier, and problems that don't have easy answers, you must confront the unknown with experiments and courage, doing what scares you, ON PURPOSE, to know what you do not know, because you are not enough, unless you have all that you need and want. unless you are all that you need and want, unless you do what you need and want. do not deny reality. emotions guide. you dont need fight unecessary fights, but you need to stand up for yourself. think of it as self-defense, NOT unnecessary offense. life is a mess, it truly is. but i may be greater inside than i think, and i may be up to the challenge. but this is a matter of life and death, good and evil, order and chaos, decisions and fate.\n\ni’ve been thinking a lot about mistakes. about why i’m scared to make them, especially in public, and how that fear blocks creativity, and playfulness at life. i notice that when im playing games or sports, i perform best when i don't really care that much, when i'm genuinely just having fun. but then in real life, i don't carry that playful mindset. why? even though it seems really useful.. i just want to untangle the mind. yesterday i journalled 12 pages straight. i had a lot of puzzle pieces to lay on the table. what do you do when you don't want to do something, even though it seems like it'd help you in the long run? try to find the 3rd path, the creative solution. i’m learning from @reasonisfun (lulie tanett) and david deutsch about anti-rational memes, ideas that don’t tell you what to think, but block you from thinking at all. learning how to detect antirational memes / self-coercion. i've noticed that i can't guarantee outcomes, but i can guarantee inputs. stoic shit i guess.. i fear other people's opinions, but why? maybe were socially hardwired to care about what people think. inner scorecard vs outer scorecard. i think good friends care more about your inner scorecard vs their scorecard of you, if they even think about that. consciously subconsciously or unconsciously fear of writing the “wrong” thing is one of those. sometimes i don’t want to post. but i feel like i should, because i committed to 100 days. and then i wonder, is that discipline, or is it coercion? what i’m exploring now is a kind of non-coercive productivity. not goggins-style push through the pain. but the opposite: debugging the mental blocks that kill flow. “coercion presumes infallibility.” that line hit me. whenever i obey fear, it’s like i’m assuming i know how others will react. i don’t. even messi misses goals. elon gets things wrong. rick rubin produced mediocre songs. yet they're still the players of their games.. that’s not failure, it’s fallibility. i’m learning how to forgive myself for not being perfect. how to think for myself instead of outsourcing moral authority. how to play the game of life with my own brain switched on. so yeah. let’s learn in public. mistakes and all. i want to "play at life" life is the ultimate game were all playing. if you're gonna live, might as well enjoy it, be in flow :) i notice that when we play improv here, i dont care as much about "failure" because at the start, we set the expectation that mistakes arent actually mistakes, its a low stakes flow-dojo almost. but then when we exit, and are back in the "real world" things seem so high-stakes. why? but we were in the "real world" the whole time haha. maybe its because we framed the game in a different way. maybe i can take that insight of useful frames, and apply that to areas of life that i historically take way too seriously, and maybe get better results. because yeah everyone would change certain dimensions of life if they had a magic wand, but we don't know how, but we CAN know. how can we make things worse? haha "the bad is next to the good" i seem to care a lot about and think a lot about morality / ethics. why? because of my religious hardwiring? even if i fail and fail and fail, i think my family will still love me right? idk..\n\n
