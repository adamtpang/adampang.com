Posts found on X have mentioned that such analyses have been conducted, suggesting that the outcomes align with expectations for a platform of its nature.\n\nif i can master questioning and deleting in elons algo, im halfway there. master fundamentals like in soccer, begin with end in mind: what do i do all the time in soccer? touch, vision, and passing. so rondos are great. and practice shooting, dribble shooting, with a defender for practice, get into the rhythm\n\nuse exponential pricing. so sell 1 for 1 dollar, then double price, then sell 2 for 2 dollars, duble price. sell 4 for 4 dollars. keep this algo up till i cant get x sales in x days or so, then revert to previous pricing and repeat. this is my do things that dont scale pricing model. are magnitudes linear? i think so\n\nwventually ill be able to index any @social account and see how many degrees seperation from people i follow or whats their pagerank index, and i can curate the people that follow me too, like trimming a hedge. as i curate my following feed i shall too with followers. i want peer relationships i grade by how many 2 ways…\n\nomg youre attracted to repos who are aligned along a vector to the goal state you want. we as people are as cells, of life itself of logos. we want what we dont have in the name of the throughline. its literally a vector, and the goal state changes. maybe thats why people are subconsciously not into certain races/genetics\n\nlife is just like machining: feeds and speeds. keeps, notion cal, ig, twitter, gmail, all feeds, and even real life feeds (mama nagging). its all feed management. clean cal clean life. cal is my life compiler. its not "think about self less" its "think about good things beyond you more" visa-laden. think more about what you want to see more of\n\nwhat personality traits are you looking for for your ns? healthy wealthy wise agentic what else? good vibes? vibe check, aura check, certain amount of socials reach? or this is why i wanna make a socials pagerank because someone with 3 mags of followers, but his pagerank index is hella high is a gem, this is moneyball right here with math and stats yuh\n\nget 1 finished app on anchor marianas digital store, get funding. sell for 1 dollar 10 times, then double price, then double price, find the sweet spot. figure out mathematically optimal pricing algo. finishing 1 before the presales, shows what you can expect. i like comparrow, maybe todont, maybe hower. check domain price and gpt check which is best name\n\nfind a mathematically optimal pricing way and sell as tool. connects to your stripe or lemon squeezy api then calculates past sales and current price and makes an adjustment. you can set the bounds of how much chnage or let it go for you. it can notify you it will change price to xyz tomorrow. kinda like auto stock trading. whats the math behind the best pricing algos for max value capture. use the pricing app to price the app, and have it affect all my other anchor marianas products. make apps that improve my other apps mwahahaha\n\ncode IS a physical transformation, its electron configging, like neuronal configging or wiring, like when you learn or unlearn something. pain = plasticity. like the tower of babel, you go up and up and up, and when you inevtiably face an unknown, an error, a wrong judgement, the internal wiring topples down to the point where it BECAME wrong. thats the mistake in beating yourself up too much. you SHOULD have a healthy amount of self-doubt to avoid hubris, but not SO much where you destroy GOOD wiring/s and leave life on the table, its like poker, optimal bet sizing, optimal folding. tbd\n\nData Collection: Gathering enough data to accurately place users would be challenging, requiring user participation or sophisticated analysis of user behavior. User Interface: Crafting an intuitive UI to navigate and understand this spatial representation would be vital for user adoption. Algorithm Development: Developing algorithms that not only place users but also predict or suggest other accounts for alignment would need to be both accurate and transparent to avoid bias accusations. Ethical Considerations: Ensuring this tool promotes healthy discourse and does not exacerbate social divides would be crucial.\n\nNetwork Discovery: Users could discover new, high-quality accounts or "gems" that align with their interests but are not yet in their network, enhancing their X experience. Community Building: It would foster a sense of community by highlighting common interests or connections, potentially leading to more meaningful interactions. Content Curation: By identifying commonly followed accounts, users might receive a curated list of content that's more relevant to them, improving content quality in their feed. Engagement Boost: Such a feature could increase user engagement as people explore new connections and content.\n\nEcho Chamber Effect: If the algorithm only surfaces accounts similar to those already followed, it might reinforce existing views or interests, limiting exposure to diverse perspectives. Privacy: Even with aggregate data, individual privacy could be at risk, especially if the visualization inadvertently reveals personal connections or interests. Algorithmic Bias: The method for determining 'gem accounts' could introduce biases, favoring accounts based on popularity rather than quality or relevance. Data Overload: For users with a large number of followings, the amount of data to process could be overwhelming, potentially leading to a cluttered or confusing UI.\n\nShallow PageRank Crawl: You could start by focusing on a subset of the network, like influencers or a specific community, to keep the scale manageable. You would need to consider how to handle rate limits, account for privacy settings, and ensure compliance with X's terms. Exploring Layers from an Account: For a 10-layer deep exploration from a single account, you'd crawl through followers and followings, potentially analyzing retweets, mentions, or hashtag usage for connectivity. This would give you insights into network structure but remember, depth in social networks can grow exponentially, and you might hit practical limits or encounter accounts with private settings.\n\nOAuth Authentication: Users would authenticate via OAuth to allow your service access to their following list. Data Aggregation: Collect and aggregate who your followers follow. Algorithm Development: Develop an algorithm to identify commonalities and rank accounts (perhaps using metrics like follower count, engagement rates, but also incorporating uniqueness or quality indicators). UI/UX Design: Design a user interface where the social graph is not only visually appealing but also interactive, allowing users to zoom, pan, and explore connections. Privacy Settings: Implement controls for users to manage what data is shared or how their network is represented. Feedback Mechanism: Allow users to provide feedback on the recommendations to refine the algorithm over time.\n\nFor such a project to be successful, it would need to balance between providing valuable networking insights and respecting user privacy, all while ensuring the UI remains engaging and not overwhelming. it would be kind of cool to see spatial voting, like how balaji talks about the ideological borders, the mental borders that we all have, and seeing where we stand on different vectors, and mental alignment, then you could see an index of accounts that most align with you 25 web pages Incorporating the concept of spatial voting into social media, particularly in the context that Balaji Srinivasan discusses regarding ideological and mental borders, could offer a new dimension to how users perceive and interact with social networks. Here's how this could work and what implications it might have:\n\nPagerank Index Leaderboard for IG and X: This project seems innovative, aiming to provide a new metric of influence and engagement on social media platforms, which could have a significant impact on how social media analytics are perceived. It's scalable, potentially disruptive in the social media analytics space, and could be interesting if you're passionate about social media metrics. Medium size, Medium fun, Yes for both 'would rich people buy it?' and 'would I use it?' - This aligns well with Musk's criteria for innovation and disruption. Xray.social - Analytics + Actions for X and IG: This project addresses the issue of flat metrics in social media, providing a deeper analysis of quality over quantity, which is innovative. It's potentially very scalable given the widespread use of these platforms and could disrupt the current analytics market by introducing quality metrics. Medium size, Medium fun, Yes for both 'would rich people buy it?' and 'would I use it?' might be a stripe api connector custom button that you put in, that changes price based on your revenue, like superwall, where it maximizes based on revenue activity and rides the wave of supply and demand. 1.
