learning is about relevance

post my teachers teachers

relevance is the key to learning

as a dropout, if i were to go to traditional college, what major would i pick? physics/math cant go wrong, but its pretty general. mechanical? nuclear? more specific, lots of physics and math overlap. focus on the best atom-problems first: energy gas manufacturing (advanced and housing)

give awesome resources to learn certain things. cheatsheets

schools got it backward, like elon said, teach to the problem, not the tool. learning and flow is all about relevance, and certain triggers: clear goals, immediate feedback, challenge skills balance. maths is relevant WHEN its relevant, when it comes into play for your mechanical engineering project

unbundling college

find advanced manufacturing bootcamp?

a degree is a status thing, the university is a talent aggregator, its cost rises, its a luxury brand
