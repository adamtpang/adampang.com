what is stopping you.

how do you solve that?

brett hall start here.

never met a kid so smart.

face is more dangerous than name.

such a waste of training time omg.

no bullshit, no homework and shit.

arguably the best feature of the bundle.

if you dont come here and youre awesome, why?

well first are you the right person for this?

education hilton.\n\nschool is hella coercive.

i mean if you get good scholarships then maybe.

ill teach them timeless things (proper tradition).

physics/math cant go wrong, but its pretty general.

curiosity based problem based, self paced learning.

ill make sure they get the fundamentals of life down.

provable results to harbor people who wanna switch away.

obviously guide them away from digital heroin like porn.

see elon.\n\nwrite about trying to start a school at ns.

provable results to harbor people who wanna switch away.

hes a kid in demeanor, an adult in intellect, its insane.

like fda faa nrc etc.\n\nhow do we have alt education that works.

these are fundamental\n\neducation is for market value and living.

do you have the knowledge, can you prove it, and on a repeated basis?

even though it costs them or their parents SOOOO much money and for what?

but adults maybe should not play games unless they play life well already.

with timezones and all\n\non principle, education should not be time based.

how else can i guard against negative fame?\n\ndaycare and montesorri school.

sports knows this, lamine yamal was 16 and euro\n\nmake a great youtube series thread.

can we measure the worst regulations in proportion to how much they hold back good shit?

can we measure the worst regulations in proportion to how much they hold back good shit?

cheatsheets

schools got it backward, like elon said, teach to the problem, not the tool.

with timezones and all\n\nmake every blog post about understanding, then a hw assignment.

I like doing things at my own pace.\n\nwe gotta know that were doing this for a good reason?

crash course philosophy, brett hall chapter explanations, harvard ethics, the economic machine.

boys and girls will learn different things.\n\n

more specific, lots of physics and math overlap.

ai and links teach kids how to internet dig\n\nuse mama and grammy for educational funds like ns.

not only are you restricted time wise and youre stressed and you cant sleep omg thats the #1 thing.

if stanford or MIT had all the curriculum for free, and you got the same exact diploma, what does that mean?

but you may have mixed outcomes with the people curation you find: could be sheep, could be talent curation and good.

template franchizable schools that prep children for the real world\n\ni can get 1517 and nautilus kids to teach kids.

video games are better when theyre social, its good practice for kids and adolescents for the biggest game we know, life.

+ "dont give a man a fish, teach a man to fish..."\n\nI wanted to go to online school in sophomore year because it would be at my own pace.

you learn by doing.\n\nwhen i was 15, i asked my parents if i could go to online school,\n\nnetwork school before state is a good move perhaps.

maths is relevant WHEN its relevant, when it comes into play for your mechanical engineering project

unbundling college

find advanced manufacturing bootcamp?

how to unbundle, improve, then bundle whats best and remains?\n\nthe real industry is a small number of people, reputation matters\n\neducation first principles.

who is this for, understanding-content, then mini hw assignments 1-2\n\nthe higher reputation you have, the better prices as a user and the better gigs you get as a doer.

never let the fire of curiosity be snuffed out\n\nok ive created space, now i need to listen for the magic, now that ive made space\n\nan issue on guam might be education.

maybe its the wrong timing idk, and im the wrong person for the job, i still dont quite understand why the mistake happened, but i did tutor balaji's kid and wow hes so smart for his age.

we gotta lean into the internet and AI shit.\n\nns bootcamp: Education and Access: We need to upskill people for these higher-level roles.\n\nuse mama and grammy for educational funds like ns.

where will the adjacent network schools be?\n\neducation should be based on relevance, wisdom, embodied practices, meta-learning and problem solving\n\nyou need as much fish to last your fishing education.

what kinds of people do we want more of?\n\nmake specs for education for the new age: state allowed, parents will actually be willing as an alt, and show better results like thiel fellows\n\nkhan academy is great learning resource.

to mentor and be mentored, you basically get to work at an edtech startup.\n\nvervaeke advises physical flow, a meditative practice where you look at lens, then a contemplative practice where you use lens\n\ncreate friction to negative fame how?

before regular school, kids were homeschooled, but its a weird transition to make in an industrialized world, theres lots to be done\n\nbasically just homeschool kids and arm them with ai and the internet for them to learn how to solve their problems.

a degree is a status thing, the university is a talent aggregator, its cost rises, its a luxury brand

call em teachers vs heroes

permissionless education
permissionless leverage
permissionless

schools got it backward, like elon said, teach to the problem, not the tool.

maths is relevant WHEN its relevant, when it comes into play for your mechanical engineering project

with every schooling, youre competing with the fellow students

vsauce kid

learning is about relevance

post my teachers teachers

relevance is the key to learning

as a dropout, if i were to go to traditional college, what major would i pick?

maths is relevant WHEN its relevant, when it comes into play for your mechanical engineering project\n\nyour reputation should precede you\n\npod schools, not industrialized school\n\nmeditative, contemplative, physical flow\n\ni can also leave space, a vacuum, for mental clarity\n\npraxis has a regulatory sandbox from that government..\n\npraxis has a regulatory sandbox from that government..\n\n- master reading writing and maths.
