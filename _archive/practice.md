time is relative.

higher resolution?

time is a 1 way door.

wider perspective idk.

dont wanna get cocky now..

the least bad is the best?

it will give you perspective.

manifestations of the spirit.

training yourself in certain ways.

there is no “position from nowhere”?

i kinda like both idk what works for me.

begin with the problem not the ground up.

we cant verify everything from the ground up.

taleb and naval dont like calendars but tim does.

sometimes a different useful frame makes everything fuckin clear.

maybe theory conflicts are two frames that need a bigger unifying frame.

haha\n\neven from the things and people and places you love, take a break.

say i did 7 days of research, i saw the importance from the eleucidian mysteries.

breadth and depth\n\ni wonder how english would look and sound if i didnt know it.

i felt like i lived longer from 18-22 than 1-18.

life is constant obsessive practice\n\nremember that ive only met 1/800,000,000 people on the internet / world.\n\ni see life clearer now i think.

friends do diff stuff we just speak what we honestly know about reality, and its interesting what we dont share, like reverse ig reverse linkedin, like bereal.

like were only seeing the elephant foot or tusk or trunk but if we can zoom out we see the whole elephant\n\ntalk about the importance of framing, how i felt it with psychadelics, use ai to illustrate the notes i made (check keeps).

fish cant see the water theyre in till they move to another pond.\n\ni love when you leave a project or take a break from something, you come back to it with fresh eyes, fresh insights, that you had to leave the myopicness of it to see\n\nare routines programming yourself?

something is always somewhere?\n\nyouve probably only really met 1/10 million of all humans, and those are probably only 1/10 million of all life forms, and those are probably only 1/10 million of all beings in the universe, and those are probably only 1/10 million of all universes in the everett, and those are probably only...\n\ncalendars are time-based todolists.

same with sinners to saints, or whatever\n\nvalues can get changed with transformative truths and comunity reinforcement like dont die cult lol and sg trip im convinced now i got prop and persp knowing now\n\nsometimes its unhelpful to use days as frames, its not about just today its about this week this month this year this decade this life this dont die life your lineage etc.\n\ni thought id be same from 18 onward but i was so wrong.
