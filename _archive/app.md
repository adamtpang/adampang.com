its a long shot to say you share a ton of the same top ult songs. well is it? i dont think so actually, like you share 5 ult songs. you have a score of 5, you share the same genres by56% you share the same top artists by 79%. make a formula score and leaderboard, finding people with same taste as you using the stats api. from there it will show songs from the most compatible people, in proportion to how compatible they are. so itll create a personalized s&p of most compatible people, then give you their top alt songs in proportion to how compatible, and songs you havent listened to. i like that. the real test is if i can get people to join to get their spotify data, and whether the recommendations beat dj and playlist miner and discover weekly. i think theyre kinda weak but not sure if i can do better. well theyre called experiments not guarantees lol.\n\ncheck warpcast bounties and build out the warpcast app\n\ngood mobile voice to text app make this check if exists\n\nmake idi app for wholesale distribution online ordering\n\nwith each idea, make the minimal webflow/flow of the app\n\ngoogle cal integration. go from task to cal event quickly\n\ncall the whoop caffeine app "teatime" dot io or somehting\n\nmake the queue up a youtube channel chrome extension?

NO NO NO. the app should be human judgement taste. so if a song is super high on my stats for spotify list. if on my ult list, it will find other spotify users who share music taste and create a compatibility score. so everyone who signs up, the app gets better, now thats a metcalfe network. so if you like certain songs, and someone else is really compatible with you, their songs you havent listened to get recommended. but how do you know if youre musically compatible? its a long shot to say you share a ton of the same top ult songs. well is it? i dont think so actually, like you share 5 ult songs. you have a score of 5, you share the same genres by56% you share the same top artists by 79%. make a formula score and leaderboard, finding people with same taste as you using the stats api. from there it will show songs from the most compatible people, in proportion to how compatible they are. so itll create a personalized s&p of most compatible people, then give you their top alt songs in proportion to how compatible, and songs you havent listened to. i like that. the real test is if i can get people to join to get their spotify data, and whether the recommendations beat dj and playlist miner and discover weekly. i think theyre kinda weak but not sure if i can do better. well theyre called experiments not guarantees lol.\n\n
