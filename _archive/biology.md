evolution is deviation selection. thats literally males females

superorganism w adam pangelinan

generation (male), selection (females), is how the humanity superorganism

is violence curation? is violence needed for curation or is mere economics a good enough curator of genetics?

emergent properties gotta be a wonder of the world. file this under awe insights. talk about the living chain from the first life forms to us. our ancestors got this far, its our turn to hold the candle and not let the candle of life go out

generation (male), selection (females), is how the humanity superorganism

our genes go through male and female manifestations through time. maybe thats why the anima animus, ying yang has an 8020 split.

its pretty crazy how species branch off from one another with time and deviation. like edo period. we cant mate with chimps. humanity is on its own when it comes to species. homo sapiens

think about you, then your parents, and then their parents, all the way back to the first liforms on earth. its our time, you are a part of this huge thing called life

Cultural and Ideological Alignment: Challenge: People's willingness to align with a network state based on ideology rather than geography requires a significant cultural shift, which is currently not widespread enough to materialize the concept fully. Sources: Srinivasan's discussions on the shift from geographical to ideological communities are central to his vision but face practical challenges in real-world application.\n\n
