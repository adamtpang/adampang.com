of course im a beginning writer talking about writing. its just the first meta move, its the classic move lol

this blog is like my fermentation lab, and whatever i think is really good, ill highlight on twitter, IG whatever

doing 100 things, visa style

reminds me that rick and morty episode where the author starts writing about an author loldo narduar research before podcast

**

topicize my essays. tag each in the markdown

essayist, not blog post

make each title of post a directive

experiment with titles. click-bait? nah, accurate but to the point

revise the why blog post

why am i writing? whats the point of this? what if i say embarassing things? who am i writing to? does that matter? (rick rubin)

3 writing sessions done

how do you hide harsh transformative truths? through fiction, through fools, through complexity

rate my own essays / blog posts, color code, point to the best ones on IG and twitter

share that writing is the basis for other media, like a screenplay to film

trim the chapters. like rick rubin, do it for me, listen to noone else? i mean trust yourself, and your ignorance...

words first. courage speech vision all in one. action. writing is thinking, no? its clarity-smithing
