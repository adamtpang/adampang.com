maybe godfather 3 etc im missing 1.

works best for good potential shows.

each tweet is a blog each blog a tweet.

i mean trust yourself, and your ignorance...

provide examples\n\ngood writing is underrated.

broadcasting to others* is still self-notetaking.

like rick rubin, do it for me, listen to noone else?

of course im a beginning writer talking about writing.

through fiction, through fools, through complexity

words first.

ask gpt to be critical of the drafts, and ask for raw note themes.

the highest fair price.\n\nremove adjectives and adverbs from the book.

also im not a writer so just release the idea for someone whos a writer who knows what theyd write.

tag each in the markdown

make each title of post a directive

experiment with titles.

its clarity-smithing

great copy, great titles.\n\nwords first.

don’t let it write, only analyze and soundboard.\n\ntiered pricing like steph smith, but able to retract, maybe binary search when going back.

the reason to be private is to be considerate, tmi is noise\n\nopen source writing would be great for got late season and with ai demonstrations, and also for what other show sucked in writing at end?

like 40 bucks for listcal.ai or like ai usage billing\n\nclarity of thought, writing is an s tier skill: code, journalling for mental clarity, songwriting, communication, essays\n\nstart early: gigi ns diary odd day.

like 50 to 100, and if it fails at 100 in 100 days, make it 75\n\nwith every tweet and blog line, like sivers and naval say, make each line able to stand on its own\n\nblog a lot more for practice before tweeting more.

through fiction, through fools, through complexity

rate my own essays / blog posts, color code, point to the best ones on IG and twitter

share that writing is the basis for other media, like a screenplay to film

trim the chapters.

it speaks on your behalf, its high signal\n\na well written kids show is the equivalent of accessible simple worded good writing.\n\na well written kids show is the equivalent of accessible simple worded good writing.\n\nwords first.

both standalone and relates to other blog posts and other internet links\n\nthe basics of grammar are cool and all, but theres so much color to be had if you break the rules a bit and add your little writing isms in there, youre own personal notetaking style.

its just the first meta move, its the classic move lol

this blog is like my fermentation lab, and whatever i think is really good, ill highlight on twitter, IG whatever

doing 100 things, visa style

reminds me that rick and morty episode where the author starts writing about an author loldo narduar research before podcast
