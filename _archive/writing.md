of course im a beginning writer talking about writing. its just the first meta move, its the classic move lol

this blog is like my fermentation lab, and whatever i think is really good, ill highlight on twitter, IG whatever

doing 100 things, visa style

reminds me that rick and morty episode where the author starts writing about an author loldo narduar research before podcast

**

topicize my essays. tag each in the markdown

essayist, not blog post

make each title of post a directive

experiment with titles. click-bait? nah, accurate but to the point

revise the why blog post

why am i writing? whats the point of this? what if i say embarassing things? who am i writing to? does that matter? (rick rubin)

3 writing sessions done

how do you hide harsh transformative truths? through fiction, through fools, through complexity

rate my own essays / blog posts, color code, point to the best ones on IG and twitter

share that writing is the basis for other media, like a screenplay to film

trim the chapters. like rick rubin, do it for me, listen to noone else? i mean trust yourself, and your ignorance...

words first. courage speech vision all in one. action. writing is thinking, no? its clarity-smithing

great copy, great titles.\n\nwords first. courage speech vision all in one. action. writing is thinking, no? its clarity-smithing\n\nshare that writing is the basis for other media, like a screenplay to film\n\nshow, dont tell\n\nwriting forces you to get specific\n\nshow, dont tell\n\ncant beat good writing\n\nwriting forces you to get specific\n\nrecruit the best people from x and ig to ns\n\ncharge a fair price. the highest fair price.\n\nremove adjectives and adverbs from the book. provide examples\n\ngood writing is underrated. it speaks on your behalf, its high signal\n\na well written kids show is the equivalent of accessible simple worded good writing.\n\na well written kids show is the equivalent of accessible simple worded good writing.\n\nwords first. courage speech vision all in one. action. writing is thinking, no? its clarity-smithing\n\nmake the price of each app the highest fair price IMO. like 40 bucks for listcal.ai or like ai usage billing\n\nclarity of thought, writing is an s tier skill: code, journalling for mental clarity, songwriting, communication, essays\n\nstart early: gigi ns diary odd day. ask gpt to be critical of the drafts, and ask for raw note themes. don’t let it write, only analyze and soundboard.\n\ntiered pricing like steph smith, but able to retract, maybe binary search when going back. like 50 to 100, and if it fails at 100 in 100 days, make it 75\n\nwith every tweet and blog line, like sivers and naval say, make each line able to stand on its own\n\nblog a lot more for practice before tweeting more. each tweet is a blog each blog a tweet. both standalone and relates to other blog posts and other internet links\n\nthe basics of grammar are cool and all, but theres so much color to be had if you break the rules a bit and add your little writing isms in there, youre own personal notetaking style. broadcasting to others* is still self-notetaking. the reason to be private is to be considerate, tmi is noise\n\nopen source writing would be great for got late season and with ai demonstrations, and also for what other show sucked in writing at end? maybe godfather 3 etc im missing 1. maybe death note. works best for good potential shows. oh its naruto. also im not a writer so just release the idea for someone whos a writer who knows what theyd write. have jello apocaypse for the game development judgement\n\n
