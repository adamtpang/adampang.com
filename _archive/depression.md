fashion is a signal.

but yeah focus on stoic action.

wallpapers and art are signals.

its like life gives you a budget, and you decide on how to spend your budget.

because it costs so much objectively, that only what youre obsessed about is cheap to you\n\ncompress truth and directives.

balance speed, volume, compression\n\nyou must have something to show for all that compression\n\npeople need to see reps people like them if they wanna gain more trust\n\ntech merch is a signal.

its all expression.\n\ni like compressing truths and directives for when my bandwidth suffers, and only the compressed can fit through that bandwidth\n\nnatural synergy thread + i think resonance applies, when 2 are equally far and equidistant from center, they resonate together\n\nonly do the super hard thing if youre obsessed.

for those low bandwidth moments\n\npeople need to see reps people like them if they wanna gain more trust\n\ni like compressing truths and directives for when my bandwidth suffers, and only the compressed can fit through that bandwidth\n\n

i havent been SUPER depressed, at most mildly

often its a body problem first, meaning that health trio isnt in a good place: sleep, diet, exercise

huberman talks about 5 pillars: sleep, light, diet, exercise, relationships

depression and feeling better is like possibilities vs lessened of possibilities.
