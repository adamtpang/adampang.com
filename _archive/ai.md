train my voice on ai open source voice replicator

run each blog post through gpt

gpt is a soundboarding

put gpt on tools

include GPT's thoughts with my blog posts

blind: nothing
serendipity: location, code and media
detection: learning, axioms + rederivation
attraction: combinatoric skills knowledge connections location

genetic weights like a neural net, but a genetic net of skillpoints like in an rpg, a starting archetype, predispositions

the 4d world plays out in 3d, the 5d world plays out in time

train an ai bot on johnathan bi's transcripts?

algorithms
- binary search for youtube / netflix

with keeps, i write subroutines for myself. is wisdom not a more and more nuanced decision tree? like a neural net

gpt is great, its just like google personifed

make an ai minimal pic of me. black on white background. just do shit

balaji made a great point: different configurations of humans were capable of different things. like potions and reagents

now i see pain as plasticity for a neural net, it has meaning for problem solving

solve a good problem, then try to get time again. output should be time disconnected, just judgement





elon just fails through the thielien overdetermination lol

because ai is solving problems for people, nvidia is MORE in demand.
demand is created when a new means of problem solving appears

filter out for the new names.

from the best blog posts, ill make the spotify ai audio rambles, youtube with ai imagery for presentation, digital avatar???

train my voice on ai open source voice replicator

run each blog post through gpt

often i forget insights. i started forgetting memories at 17, maybe i filled up my brain. i like how the human mind autoforgets, its like LIFO, use it or lose it. pain is plasticity, going deeper into the training of the neural net, backprop, forward prop. idk what im talking about when it comes to AI. stop reading me, what are you doing with your life? this is not relevant

harry potter renditions.\n\nxray social can also be “rolodex ai” helps you w your online presence but also helps you navigate the friends family dating on ig and x, based on what prople do. ai profile analysis, so you can do same vector activities and stuff. help solve peoples problems. ohhhh. product marketing and sales. help people w product, problem awareness understanding action, then help them market themselves via fitness style and presence ai apps, then help them sell via rolodexai””. oh ok. so i really gotta do important philosophical content on reels and shit. keep posting on X, the best goes to IG in visual form. on Feb 5, 2025 at 2:30 PM - 3:00 PM\n\ncan ai scan my tasks in comparrow and rank by timeless or timely 3 parse? so it does some preprocessing for me? yeah thats a cool twist. does it help solve the problem? also it should highlight duplicate sounding tasks, and ask to consolidate. preprocess button that: sorts by length, filters out links, finds consolidation opportunities, etc. ai-powered eisenhower todolist. make it so that I like to use it. computers X human-judgement. find a replicate high context model that actually works. maybe usage based pricing then. show social proof like rating stars and how many reviews. reach out to the people that dont like it, please submit ideasbugs why its less than 5 stars`\n\nim realizing more and more how ns can actually do so much good in the world. i know its centered around tech and its very heady and nerdy, but i just finished avatar, and this project really can change the world. and not in a naive sense, in a deep sense, this can change lives. lets map out the platonic ideal path. the core team cant afford the time to really sell it, but i can. lets map it out and what this project can afford later on, what positive things it enables. lets think on a 100 year timescale and zoom out. this is a meaningful project that can exist without us. like the mars mission. its about rebuilding a broken world in some sense. ** theres so much i can say\n\nif i can crank out music just like voidstomper does reels, like reel farm does tiktoks, that could work, stamp my name face voice, with my splice seed taste, and use ai ableton to grow that seed into a full ai composition style song, just like cursor, and easy export to soundcloud ig and spotify, that could work. get the system working first manually. i think the visuals could be better on ig. so better visuals via full on ai video like replicate or aimovie idk, but make it cheap. how? find a fast cheap good (trifecta) ai video model that matches the splice seed. make a super simple tool or an ableton plugin idk. ai seed to song composer like an ableton fork, or find open source version just like vs code is or godot\n\nget adampang.ai make adampang.com better. what makes a great personal site?

blockchain icann? somewhere to test marketing. gummysearch and reelfarm.. check all keep notes, but ai soundboard all this too on Apr 13, 2025 at 10:30 AM - 11:00 AM\n\nmake an omegle for podcasts. pick a topic, each profile has a reputation, use airchat or riverside or built in podcasting (recording audio), then it can export visual + transcription + ai slideshow + audio, just like airchat, with a random person on that topic, rated. make it mini like 10 minute chats, that can extend longer if you want, then you also put other linktrees in your profile and become internet friends. helps with practicing internet friendships. you can choose to be on camera or have your profile or an ai avatar or something, even vocal distortion. so its like discord? but for the purpose of podcast-like live riffing and then exporting it to socials, also the ai chapterizing. maybe you can go into it like private vs public, or open to both etc. and you can see how many people are online for a topic, you can see trending topics (how many people online for that) and if theres a long queue for that topic, i mean it will suggest related topics that have more people in the queue. the reputation thing lets you put filters. continue with google or metamask etc.\n\n
