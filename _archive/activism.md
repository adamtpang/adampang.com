NS is a great idea\n\ngay people have to go with coming out proceess, and their free in otherr ways from that big one they went through\n\npeople should also be able to enter in how much they want this to exist. maybe 1000 dollars. buy what you cant build\n\nfocus on pax persona before pax americana before pax humana. internet > usa. the cloud continent is 5.3 billion people\n\nstatus itslef is zero sum but if along the right moral axis is a great engine for long term positive sum change/progress\n\nlets question long standing cultural beliefs to make sure they have solid rational ethical epistemelogical philosophical grounds\n\nscience and religion are religion killers. religion is a bundle of values. let people have their own values, thats the meta value.\n\nyouve learned so much from the internet. when are you gonna start contributing to the knowlesge and code and media etc? pay it forward\n\nevery network state should have ethical hackers that try to pen test and prove the security. go after the most important funds and ledgers\n\nplay with friends: other people aligned in what im trying to do. minimal network state yo!!! every monthly burn should be a moral innovation\n\nto anyone advocating for a value or rule look at an existing example or do a thought experiment. like if you want communism check north korea\n\nif you indiehack in numbers, there is safety in numbers, thats what ns talked about. if you come for 1 of us, you have to deal with all of us\n\ncheck the x message about joining ns. make a compelling case. check twitter bookmarks and updates on ns dot com and the hashtag and twitter feed.\n\nnetwork states or schools shouldnt just be a party. were first principles redesigning SOMETHING insert articulation. around a mission purpose, like mars party\n\ntownhall should take local surveys like the chines to help inform governemnt. same for feedback forms and feature request forms on startuos, not intrusive though\n\nsocial media is a political economy holy shit. we want likes, we want good following ratios and shit. and we cant unfollow if they follow us, thats not political\n\nthe more powerful you are the more good you can do (sorts e/acc or EA laden but you get the point), and the more good you are, the better directed your power will be.\n\nspread the gospel, and if you must, use words. embodied activist!!! write about this. i often slip up and nerd out about things i think are important. i mean thats fine...\n\ni dont like mamas coercion, maybe thats all she knows. coercion doesnt get things done in the long term it just removes freedoms. which is evil. coercion and violence are evil\n\nconsent of the governed, they can leave. this is opt in, this is a social contract. we cant choose who our family is, where were born, we play with the cards we have, we make new cards\n\ni really like superteam earn solana bounties and farcaster balaji bounties, but its still trading time and energy for money. i need leverage. but i still wanna help the network state infra\n\neven the voting mechanisms can be modular. make the farcaster app and all the ns components MODULAR. maybe we use moses voting: https://thenetworkstate.com/the-network-state-in-one-thousand-words\n\nfreedom of thought, speech. decentralized thought, learn from other places and things and cultures, then merge to main. you are a mosaic, but you choose your tiles. some are more fixed than others\n\nyou can have moral innovations that are pro something andor against something. pro creatine, anti sugar. even places already people move to to be around value aligned people. you get a gauge online\n\nstrength of affiliation and retention. what are the mvp components? values, currency, census, voting, benefits and concent of the governed, crowdfunding territory, transport between nodes. what else?\n\nlet people mod, its permissionless crowd-upgrading of YOUR tech: see minecraft sticky pistons, early iphone jailbreaking, its basically like a pull request to main, same for network states and schools\n\nfind your value divergents. bringing back tribes and cults lol. but upfront positive sum design. kpis results vectors and proof. opt in and out. consent of the govern, skin in the game. stake and slash\n\n1 tweet a day, 1 reply a day from the feed if can and if useful thought to the superorganism. remember that magnets both attract and repel. or say what i think needs to be said more, in a new useful frame\n\ndoes bryan johnson, at 6-7 mags fame get death threats lol i do feel like each crowd of people has a different flavor. i mean theres mimetic sacrifice and all. is being a girardian scapegoat a good thing? idk dpeneds.\n\nin a world thats changing so quickly, the biggest risk is not taking any risk. get sourced, get explanations, get principles. the future is not fixed, this is not the end of history, get meritocratic, practice your agency\n\nand how does the public influence the public sector? i dont think anything can be done with petitions idk. the costs have to come from somewhere like taxes. i mean a select few politicians are actually good: bukele lky, milei, etc.\n\nits impossible to not offend SOMEONE. like just BEING can offend people, like racists or sexists lol. just BEING black or BEING a woman can offend. or being a white cis male will offend people. or being wealthy, even if it was earned*\n\ndont destroy the means of error corrections, this is the heart of morality. what are the means of error correction? free idea market, free genetic market, free wealth market, free jurisdiction market. what else? or what should be deleted?\n\nfor spatial voting you can make a value playlist, each being a moral commandment. everyone can create their mosaic, and layer layer layer on new communities and values and vectors. habits and projects and collective goals with people with you.\n\ni dont trust fundamentalists idk. i like augustus doricko's vibe though and i wanna be friends, its okay. friends are opt in opt out. lets be minimal coercion and violence first, lets dont die first, then lets talk. lets free speech first, then well talk lol\n\n1,1,i wanna help code out the network state i dont need to network i dont need to eat i can stay out of everyones way i can help/volunteer i can pay to be here whatever you need this is just too important. we dont even have to live there we can live nearby and commute\n\nyou can also filter by values like guam soccer, then pay 1 dollar due every month, that money goes to paying for someone to hold the goals, to fixing the light, to paying for a spot on field, for new other color bibs and a leader who takes responsibility. everyone a leader of their own value\n\nwrite about the new age, its the antiapocalypse, its not utopia, but its the closest we can get to it. capitalism can be out of form or in form: see singapore for inform, see beitain or something for out of form. its a lack of founders understanding investment and regulation that makes business unhospitable\n\nwow lky said democracy does not change gov without viiolence, but in terms of effeciency it clearly lacks. balaji suggests TRUE democracy. from 2 parties to N parties. 1 moral commandment, 1 value. bundled and bundled. layer on layer, with different innovations and stakes and progress kpis. like an etf of values\n\nusa still stands a chance against china if it can get its governance right, and maybe fork the nation red and blue? red blue and mixed how about that? keep governance human-shaped. let people be different. make america states again. if politics divides, let it divide. let results speak for themselves like sf vs miami or something\n\nwhat political party helps another party. JOIN our party, a party is a bundle of values going in a certain direction. idk if you should destroy other parties, but let them experiment AND PROVE RESULTS. let people opt in and out of value vectors if they want the future that were heading in or not. you can make these choices in your life\n\nyou dont convince people by shaming them thats just further division. its better to find commonality first meet them where they are based on what they want and illuminate logic chains one link at a time. and by teaching you also may find holes in your logic, which is good, because thats an opportunity to reconcile that, where before you were living more blind.\n\ndad wants me for geda, but i cant work on the farm only the housing or the bitcoin container farms. i need gpus for ai compute or crypto compute. but everyones buying gpus so… how about housing then and renting? buy from china? what are the minimum features where id wanna live there thats the basics of business ethics. dont sell what i wouldnt buy golden rule shit. dont die dont kill let free markets free speech freedom free vote protect the means of error correction\n\n
