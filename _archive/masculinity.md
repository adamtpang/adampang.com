what are male rites of passage nowadays?

...

for dating, i think dont force it, just level up, build a life. keep it in the background but dont obsess
not performative masculinity vs intrinsic masculinity\n\nbro there are so many humans out there that we dont have time to treat all of them with love. some we treat like objects. we need to talk to each other more. not be fake, but just connect as living creatures. we cant go at this journey alone. you is not enough people - vonnegat. i really gotta up my loving others game. not in a needy simpy way, but in a selective genuine way. not everyone deserves love? the virtuous do? everyone has free will to better themselves\n\n
