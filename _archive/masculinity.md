...

the virtuous do?

some we treat like objects.

not everyone deserves love?

we cant go at this journey alone.

we need to talk to each other more.

you is not enough people - vonnegat.

what are male rites of passage nowadays?

i really gotta up my loving others game.

not in a needy simpy way, but in a selective genuine way.

for dating, i think dont force it, just level up, build a life.

everyone has free will to better themselves\n\n

not be fake, but just connect as living creatures.

keep it in the background but dont obsess
not performative masculinity vs intrinsic masculinity\n\nbro there are so many humans out there that we dont have time to treat all of them with love.
