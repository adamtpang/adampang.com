just learn, follow curiosity. find the gaps in the world that you uniquely can create, leverage, and own

if youre cool, ill invite you into my life, and im working on bettering my life too

i like pragmatism. you wanna go there, but youre here, what do you do to get where you wanna go?

being self critical is sometimes good, but its a matter of why and when.

if you create the outline of the puzzle, the missing piece becomes clear

when does honesty go wrong? if you cant get through the short term you cant get to the long term?

just continuously learn in free markets

go through life story and what i learned from each inflection point. what to do more and less of

im practicing public expression. why? no man is an island, might as well practice. its sales

bias and blind spots are inescapable. we need heuristics though. break your ideas, at least try to, to trust. you can trust what is stress-tested

become sharp so you can be powerful AND good

but does it resonate?
but what does that mean for YOU?

well how else am i going to live?

what is courage?
should i hide what i say?
should i say what i think?
should i embarass myself on purpose?

think about the long game

traits i admire in others: not take themselves so seriously, love noah kagan and tim ferriss about that. self-deprecation sometimes idk

idk if it was jung but i think he would have his patients just ramble, then patterns would emerge, same thing im trying with the blog. im just gonna ramble, then ill consolidate, then ill clean up thoughts, itll get better and better but at least im starting. letting the perfectionist in LATER

validation from results from action from smallness

not well known, but known well. accountable. skin in game, like reputation

quirks
- i pat myself twice whenever i see myself doing something long term good. self-rewarding skinner style

smart people think far range, long range. can see the good and bad before them

only ask of people what youd do OR if they actually like to do it

be the best in the world at what you do, keep redefining yourself until this is true. if i code and blog and podcast and hardware manufacturing and music and philosophy and sports, will i be the best in the world at THAT? the combinatorics, and economics

im disciplined diligent sorta lazy, and disciplined.

leverage is like with greater power comes greater responsibility

i wouldnt feel good working on media if i didnt code a bit. i gotta do code and media

speed from clarity from knowledge from experimentation from courage

the most contrarian thing of all is to think for yourself, not oppose the crowd

these tiny twitter and blog experiments build my confidence for bigger experiments like podcasting

i wanna be systematic with my life. the unexamined life is not worth living so they say...

i love love how noah kagan doesnt take himself so seriously. hes doing great financially AND hes maintained his inner child and energy. its not a mutual exclusive thing

what is a mistake anyway? falling short of a goal because of lack of knowledge or skill, both of which can be bettered

continuous learners in free markete yo

clear conscience priceless

if not this, then what?

upskilling

life formulas/equations

why is your only reference other people whove done xyz, you gotta think 1st principles and derive Godly solutions to Devilish problems

sometimes, thinking doesnt lead you to the answer. bottom 3Ps


responsibility

learn the skills to contribute. connect the dots

saying no can be so hard but its a skill to build, no?

accountability under my own name. skin in the game

experience/skill * proving > credential

mental frameworks must be stresstested against reality


talk about going to therapy, talking needs to be a compliment to action, not a substitute, from thiel's recent talk with joe rogan

good frameworks i learnd

when i gots money, travel and shit??? live and level up so I like me

if win-wins sound too transactional? whats the better option? mark manson and danielle strachman kinda insinuate that you dont want transational? well i hangout with X person because i like them (you GET something from them...?)

current cubicle monkey, document life path and each potential branching path

12:07 After gaining skills, it's crucial to create evidence of your abilities and signal them to others.

talk about being from guam and its career challenges, maybe its a good constraint because i really focus on code and media because of it

what do i even start talking about? i guess whatever comes to mind, i can always curate later

X respected person said that. heuristics break, unknowns are known to be inevitable, mistakes will be made. so what? so what do i/you/we do?

stand the test of time, the serious people will still be here after years, if they have the endurace inheritly aligned with their nature

do not be the best, be the only. maybe guam can be a venn circle on this...

my future wife and kids are cheering me on. daughter son son

prime your mind like leaving a bucket out. you cant control the rain but when it comes, your bucket will

im a future scapegoat

anxiety and voluntary approach. doing what scares you. dont do unnecessary stuffs but when something you know you gotta do, and can do, do it.

before you compete, do you even want the prize on offer? look at worst downside best upside. thats the risk spread in a way idk

this isnt a hardship contest. thiel.

intentional mimesis. upfront incentives. as long as youre deliberate. like i want this, because this, because this. be honest. then surround yourself with people who also want that pie, then grow the pie together
