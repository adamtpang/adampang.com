make the batch script convert any link to its markdown equivalent. fix the spacing and line breaks

constants to variables

make it so that if the directory already exists, dont do anything, if there is no md for an existing directory, delete it. faster batch processing

what does code look like? tools to help me, digital store and projects, indiehacking and getting used to my LLC and stripe

coding with AI is like soundboarding and pseudocoding

do bubble sort first, then get to quicksort. just get started. aim for speed and volume at first, let the perfectionist in late

just like in code, use the most abstracted functions and languages, as is reasonable. only go deep when the gist doesnt cut it
