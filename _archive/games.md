ive been wanting to make eyeland. imagine a legend elon card, or zuck card. a tech game

the game theory optimal way for good prisoners dilemma relationships is bid for long term, if they fuck with you, fuck them over / have boundaries, then try again for the long term, train them. punish them if they deserve, but keep trying for the good

played spyfall and mafia\n\npositive sum ethical games\n\nive been wanting to make eyeland. imagine a legend elon card, or zuck card. a tech game\n\nthe game theory optimal way for good prisoners dilemma relationships is bid for long term, if they fuck with you, fuck them over / have boundaries, then try again for the long term, train them. punish them if they deserve, but keep trying for the good\n\nif i dont have negotiation power, then earn with virtue so i "win" all infinite game theory fair negotiations\n\nMINECRAFT IS REAL!!\n\ni love schelling points\n\nson name: eden matthew pang\n\nreminds me of fifa career mode\n\ni view life as a game of games\n\nside quest reward for the main quest.\n\ndesign the good game, play the game well\n\nlife is a game, and im a game dev for it\n\nsay i got into game design and making in godot\n\nlocal legends can gamify even more pickup soccer\n\nthen walk along the path on the map, to reach goal\n\nlife be like: https://graebor.itch.io/sort-the-court\n\nmultiplayer social competitive game. is this a trap?\n\nplay is flow. what do i just want to play? hearthstone?\n\nwhen you learn all you can from a game, it gets boring.\n\nspecific knowledge: scavenger hunt world builder game dev\n\ntboi start here + tboi is a comprehensive upgrading worldview.\n\nvenn diagram: infinite game and game theory is infinite game theory\n\ncookie clicker great for teaching leverage and compounding and judgement\n\ngotta pass the short game to get to the long game + infinite game thread\n\n"web of deserved trust, and we did deals forever" "stag hunt" "pve > pvp"\n\nturn-based games sorta teach that every play is independent from the next.\n\nwrite about riff with the nice. game theory optimal algo. the infinite game\n\n"fair" is vocab for infinite game players. + game theory optimal post thread\n\nopening up the map will be great. bro (balaji) is literally playing civilization\n\nive been wanting to make eyeland. imagine a legend elon card, or zuck card. a tech game\n\nhow do you get famous? ratio of women to men, jealousy. leader of men, fame brain shit.\n\nkids will play games, but teach things in the flow. courses for the new age baked into eyeland\n\n>i wanna make eyeland, my dream card game rpg (hearthstone meets pokemon meets modded minecraft)\n\nturn your life into a game, for the sake of flow-maxxing. life is the real game. realness matters\n\nmemes and ideas replicate just like people. learn the best ideas and mental scaffolds, explanations\n\nnft game assets / metaverse assets. **. metaverse is life game and video games intersecting. love that\n\nif i dont have negotiation power, then earn with virtue so i "win" all infinite game theory fair negotiations\n\ngame theory optimal: if you'll be good to me, i'll be good to you. game theory rules dictate the infinite game.\n\ndo the same as network state but with tboi: get a pdf and the audiobook, read in parallel, find or make this tool\n\nwere self interested, and we should be, but lets be honest. this is the importance of game theory and positive sum\n\njust play in life. play the infinite game. if you get to the top of the game, stop playing the game. the meta game\n\nevery vector, measure, is a game. + when you win a game you must stop playing, higher games await. + measurement gamifies.\n\ndo 100 thing is for measurement, but if i get wealthy before 100, im not finishing the 100, its just for flow, for gamification\n\nwrite about fame: why i choose a pseudonym, the sweet spot of fame. sivers is just right, tim ferriss' is too much. i think in terms of mags\n\nfame is more material, more generation. by itself thats chaos. needs proper curation to manage it, like a more powerful horse needs a better rider.\n\nwhen i create wealth and win, i can help the good people to win, and do the game theory algo for the bad peiple. give a chance punish give a chance punish\n\nthere is a sweet spot of fame. shark fish analogy. the power law the celebs attract most fame, like gravity, but if youre not online, youre digitally invisible\n\ni think gamifying is still good. study game design, game theory. you can find ways to gamify your biggest problems and have daily challenges, its fun, its flowy.\n\nwhen you win a game you must stop playing. higher games await. life is the infinite game full of games. every measured vector is a game + measurement gamifies. + you must say no the opp cost is too high.  + **\n\nadd my digital band to eyeland too. modular universe lol, archiving the bad shit. building leverage. some more serious projects some more playful unserious projects. dont play video games make video games. godot\n\npost the credibility hacking: books, people, and visible competence of tetris hs app academy network school. the game you choose to play is WAY more important than being good at it. if its fun, then thats cool too. show proof of the people and the games screenshots\n\nwrite about the frame of fame where its like the big magnets or big gravity take most of the hits, theres a sweet spot. also the radar analogy. talk about how people irl ALREADY know your name and face. its like a star vs sun, you CAN find a star if you want, the sun takes up most of the salience though.\n\neyeland was a kpop tech rock band game. each island bringing a new theme. cryptids fantasy. basically archetypes i wanted. pokemon. but with a deckbuilder rpg base, with modular sandbox like minecraft. it should let players build their own stories too or something and a leaderboard. gotta have lots of freedom though like minecraft computer craft, they should be able to program it easily. like pokemon and hs. you should be able to have a sandpox pvp arcade from home screen, our own main quest mode, playermade modes. like w101. bring the best of all my fav games. how will ai help game dev? godot making super fast. scope this idea down, get the gems from previous. ugh games are vitamins and traps like porn. but its so fun. not until i finish my next 2 milestones\n\n
