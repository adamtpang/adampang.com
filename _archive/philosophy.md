epistemology, ethics, aesthetics

check out crash course philosophy

i heard a good point about the world, if everyone were philosophical (like me) we wouldnt get anything done, thats why the big 5 has variation for the superorganism

life is a puzzle

life is the meta game

maybe lying is seen as unethical because youre distorting reality for someone else, misleading. which kinda means that truth is a super ethical thing. because truth helps with survival.

maybe i think in darwininian ethical terms idk

...

what is my life philosophy? death is a 1-way door, i might as well see this life through, i want to see how far i can go, how far the people i know can go, humanity, all of life lol

aiming for polymathy


satisfice. good enough. come on, you know this

make an accessible bible. what happened, what does it mean etc.

life is like infinite gradient descent with a changing landscape

time is a frame, statistics is a frame,

1-way doors: death, fame

power is neutral

this is but a manifestation, not the spirit or principle

what do i have endurance for? learning? philsoophy?


good people deserve good outcomes of course

what returns is deep

all advice cancels to zero


nietzsche almost had me. i beat one of the final bosses of philosophy. broke free

i like long ranging thinkers, people that explore the idea maze, AND go through it

sufficiently nuanced advice is indistinguishable from chaos

basically be a philosopher king. capitalist ethicist. strong and good

good has to win in the end. its more nuanced than good and bad.

this is a test. the obstacle is the way. voluntarily approach. amor fati

a lack of nuanced thought is a bad sign

what do you saliently want? why? what is good and evil? why? act along with thinking

what makes a so called intellectual? isnt it up to the listener to decide. there is no threshold from preartist to artist. its more about action no?

the question is the answer

socrates is ugly? lol

time dampens or accelerates

i think the seeking, the questioning is exploration

stoicism is incomplete. yeah the locus of control is a great coping mechanism and makes sense. but yeah outcomes matter too. inputs and outputs, means and ends BOTH matter. the internal AND the external

so ambition is just will to power?

is every school of thought bias and mixed, and a yin to the yang is needed to fill the void, and even that has a yin, never the perfect answer in every situation, so a cycle emerges, a recursive morality, built upon humanity's mechanisms and societal psychology

study nietzsche's life itself. i admire his boldness

will something rather than nothing


karl popper got falsifiability so right. what test would prove that nietzsche's will to power is the "right" framework to live by?

i havent been able to break darwinian morality. it can hold christianity and paganism no?

not in kind but in degree

the will to power is real
yeah im selfish at least right now. i see both sides. pagan and christian

i should learn more nietzsche

girard came up with a great theory that explains anthropological, political, economic phenomena

so communism paganizes christianity... wow. thats like i = e^2, but philosophical


myths contain messages not doctrins

i would be different with power and so would you, no? i guess well only know with a test

if being good is not enough, power is whats needed. will to power. so nietzsche is just right?
im learning truths stronger than my previous beliefs, and the vision is not exactly positive.
is it cynicism masquerading as rationality?
or is it deep truths about humanity's inner world?
or something else altogether?

we are both spirited animals and rational agents

what are my meaning answers to the meaning questions?

the axis is powerful and powerless
good and evil
power is your abillity to apply force
will to live
sin and crime
powerful can commit great deeds AND great evils

the lie of degree not kind. the lie lies in its unanimity. johnathan bi

sometimes in philosophy, you must get your hands dirty. ethics

if you want to see who rules over you, see who you cant criticize, like parents

evil is often insidious, not upfront

what do you do when even in a platonic ideal, theres no consensus?

socrates was always like: "but how is that relevant TO YOU?"


thiel says psychology is a poor substitute for religion

ethics is about good and evil, and therefore life and death

i see both sides, sometimes going harder or going softer is the way. there is no one way, no free lunch, just obstacles, tools, and experiments. knowns and unknowns, positive and negative, life and death, good and evil. its all connected, yin and yang

if you get to the essence, you can have conviction as long as you got the axioms right, you can rederive life solutions

i just like getting to the essence of stuff, of life.

its dialogos

if there is even 1 counterexqmple, that wasnt a sufficient variable

thoughts die so we dont


solve a good problem, then try to get time again. output should be time disconnected, just judgement

i notice that so much of what i think is foundationed in others' thoughts. so whats mine? maybe its just the superorganism


humanity is like a superorganisms

laws of physics and people

what thoughts are my own if i just learn from others?

i like systematic, rigorous thinking about salient life

mimesis is fine as long as you think independently on what matters esp

thought experiment
thot experiment
if you could hear a little voice in your head that tells you exactly the right choice to make in every decision, with all variables considered, would you always listen to it? the other version is if you didnt have free will but could only observe the perfect life

meaning and what i know. the questions about meaning

talk about crash course philosphy
pivotal life inflection points
talk about ethics epistemology

people build reputations for truth, but its not the person, its about the truth

as long as someone else has made a similar decision, you could chalk it up to mimesis. the most contrarian thing of all is to think for yourself, not to merely oppose the crowd

i dont need to know all details, but if i understand fundamentals, i can always rederive. this is the awesomeness of philosophy

our genes go through male and female manifestations through time. maybe thats why the anima animus, ying yang has an 8020 split.

the buffet, the hallway of different world religions and ways of being. can we pick and choose? to create a new way? i think the multiplicity is good for the consumer, have multiple schools of thought and let time be the real test. that is darwinian.

capitalism communism and feature of the universe. talk about how you cant change the shape of the power law, only traverse it or change its size. better to rise and increase it. thats the only known ethical way


all advice cancels to zero, this is the invisible calculus. advice cancels to zero, but wealth can be positive sum of course, we do more with less, lest were still cavemen

if garry tan says theres too much money in the world + thiel's communism no idea conspiracy. how do we create new knowledge, ethics points us in the right direction, procedural deutschian knowledge is how to get there

is fame a faustian bargain?

consider the counterexamples. why do people do selfless acts. okay if helping the poor is still will to power. is there any thing someone can do that is truly selfless and altruistic without anything will to power-y

which is the better problem to solve for fellow humans?

cowardice as morality.

Jordan Peterson

not destroying the means of error-correction is the basis of morality - deutsch. so thats why free speech is actually a good vs evil kind of thing, its actually that important huh...

is adam smith's invisible hand ethics true? this ties to dunbar's number too. everyone in the world cant be relevant to you, and thats just humanity, theres more life than just us. isnt it life and consciousness that matters? i mean we care about ourselves more, the selfish gene right? there has to be another word. the self-interested gene

what else could we know, us, the superorganism, an offshoot of life

emergent properties gotta be a wonder of the world. file this under awe insights. talk about the living chain from the first life forms to us. our ancestors got this far, its our turn to hold the candle and not let the candle of life go out

balaji made a great point: different configurations of humans were capable of different things. like potions and reagents

if physics and math are fundamentals of stem, music is fundamental to meaning/feeling, at that base level

hedonic treadmill. so meaning. you wont find a satisfying propositional answer. its about how, feel, play

the great thinkers follow the pagerank of ideas, wherever they lead. they got an etf of ideas, s&p with differing weights in mindspace

the more material wealth, the more life possible, remember that humans are both matter and what matters. we need food (matter), shelter (matter), these physical resources

death. like if we just go to sleep and dont wake up. so theres no need to fear death?

we dont have emotions, they have us.

so Christianity was a different algorithm than pagan religions? brain software is collective belief of the superorganism

what problem/s does religion solve?

humans have survived without christianity. what did the ancients do for meaning. not that i dont like christianity, i do. i see religions like multiple languages pointing to the same thing. its so weird when language A has a word that doesnt translate to language B, its like langauge B people just havent thought about that concept based on the bounds of their language. so sometimes we borrow words from different languages

religions are like different languages refering to the same thing. ALSO yaknow how certain languages have words that dont translate well? thats like a word that exists in language A but NOT B. so if you spoke language B, and heard about this new word that has no direct translation, the concept was outside the original realm of conception. catholicism and guma' uritao are mutually exclusive, but both independent emergence amongst human coallitions

is violence curation? is violence needed for curation or is mere economics a good enough curator of genetics?

the best areas are the frontier, with no map, and you need correct axioms to derive first principles solutions where there are no easy answers

its like earths a computer and humanity is an ml model with opponent processing, gradient descent, cell blockout. the universe is 13 billion years old, humans live 85 years or so, so we are like FLOPs?

we hide and hide. weaknesses. streissand effect
timesheet
nobody would be the same if they could afford to be different. if the agent could overpower the arena
what lies am i unanimously complicit in?

for what would i be willing to die for today?

think about you, then your parents, and then their parents, all the way back to the first liforms on earth. its our time, you are a part of this huge thing called life

stoicism is a branch reversion of christianity

humor is awesome, the fool and the king

nobody would be the same if they could afford to be different. arena shaping us

meritocracy is beautiful and cruel. leave the channels open

it is not the end of history. and that can be scary and exciting at the same time. change is upon us

are we all vying for wealth, therefore power, therefore status? what does this mean? is this true?

so are humans cold incentive-following creatures? including me, including you

1-way doors: death, fame

substance not time, principles

this is but a manifestation, not the spirit or principle

power is neutral

what returns is deep

nietzsche almost had me. i beat one of the final bosses of philosophy. broke free

good has to win in the end. its more nuanced than good and bad.

basically be a philosopher king. capitalist ethicist. strong and good

this is a test. the obstacle is the way. voluntarily approach. amor fati

are we all vying for wealth, therefore power, therefore status? what does this mean? is this true?

breadth then depth then breadth then depth ad infinitum

what do you saliently want? why? what is good and evil? why? act along with thinking

bias and blind spots are inescapable. we need heuristics though. break your ideas, at least try to, to trust. you can trust what is stress-tested

what makes a so called intellectual? isnt it up to the listener to decide. there is no threshold from preartist to artist. its more about action no?

socrates is ugly? lol

i think the seeking, the questioning is exploration

seperate the person from the idea, like an artist and the song.

consider the counterexamples. why do people do selfless acts. okay if helping the poor is still will to power. is there any thing someone can do that is truly selfless and altruistic without anything will to power-y

stoicism is incomplete. yeah the locus of control is a great coping mechanism and makes sense. but yeah outcomes matter too. inputs and outputs, means and ends BOTH matter. the internal AND the external

so ambition is just will to power?

is every school of thought bias and mixed, and a yin to the yang is needed to fill the void, and even that has a yin, never the perfect answer in every situation, so a cycle emerges, a recursive morality, built upon humanity's mechanisms and societal psychology

will something rather than nothing

the buffet, the hallway of different world religions and ways of being. can we pick and choose? to create a new way? i think the multiplicity is good for the consumer, have multiple schools of thought and let time be the real test. that is darwinian.

karl popper got falsifiability so right. what test would prove that nietzsche's will to power is the "right" framework to live by?

these great thinkers are people too. you are a person. what do you think? if it makes sense then follow it. make sure to not destroy the means of error correction: experiments, dialogue, first principles, emotional disaster prep. when emotions run high, and blood boils, morals can be thrown out easily

i havent been able to break darwinian morality. it can hold christianity and paganism no?

the will to power is real
yeah im selfish at least right now. i see both sides. pagan and christian

i should learn more nietzsche

so communism paganizes christianity... wow. thats like i = e^2, but philosophical

unwavering unconditional love is the way out of the mimetic process

if being good is not enough, power is whats needed. will to power. so nietzsche is just right?
im learning truths stronger than my previous beliefs, and the vision is not exactly positive.
is it cynicism masquerading as rationality?
or is it deep truths about humanity's inner world?
or something else altogether?

everyone whose put their heart on show has been crucified

the axis is powerful and powerless
good and evil
power is your abillity to apply force
will to live
sin and crime
powerful can commit great deeds AND great evils

what are my meaning answers to the meaning questions?

death. like if we just go to sleep and dont wake up. so theres no need to fear death?

youre never late, maybe for a local minima, but never for the global. the ever expanding puzzle of life

humans have survived without christianity. what did the ancients do for meaning. not that i dont like christianity, i do. i see religions like multiple languages pointing to the same thing. its so weird when language A has a word that doesnt translate to language B, its like langauge B people just havent thought about that concept based on the bounds of their language. so sometimes we borrow words from different languages

thoughts die so we dont

we dont have emotions, they have us.

do not destroy the means of error correction

i notice that so much of what i think is foundationed in others' thoughts. so whats mine? maybe its just the superorganism

so are humans cold incentive-following creatures? including me, including you

1-way doors: death, fame

stand the test of time, the serious people will still be here after years, if they have the endurace inheritly aligned with their nature

what do i have endurance for? learning? philsoophy?

what returns is deep


nietzsche almost had me. i beat one of the final bosses of philosophy. broke free

if someone has done it, you know from 1st principles its possible. but if no example, you gotta do the first principles calculus to be sure of the solution derivation

basically be a philosopher king. capitalist ethicist. strong and good

good has to win in the end. its more nuanced than good and bad.

this is a test. the obstacle is the way. voluntarily approach. amor fati

my life philosophy

time energy emotions

what thoughts are my own if i just learn from others?

i like systematic, rigorous thinking about salient life

naval said it best. if you talk to enough people, read enough books, do mushrooms, meditate enough, you realize its all connected, dont box yourself in, be a natural philosopher

a big part of the meaning crisis is reconnecting to body, and flow of course.


women bear with existence, men must prove they should live

talk about ethics epistemology

meaning and what i know. the questions about meaning

i just keep asking why. i notice that the axiomatic, base reasons sometimes dont excite me. so what does? what do i saliently want?

my current life philosophy: death is a 1 way door, so lets see what we can do in this life. will to live, will to power, will to love.

not destroying the means of error-correction is the basis of morality - deutsch. so thats why free speech is actually a good vs evil kind of thing, its actually that important huh...


boils down to time and energy. energy emotions buttons. deutschian knowledge and action

God said I am a gift. needs not wants. life is almost throwing truth at you. full body yes (ideas and feeling congruency. mind and body. left and right brain) to be on the pareto wave. what would this look like if it were small? something is imperfect/improvable with me or the world\n\nexperience and THEN the truth is revealed to you. some truths you can think before realizing. other truths need experience first before you realize. you can think ahead, or you can think behind. map and territory shit. i can empathize, articulate, write clearly yet i do write vaguely and cryptically sometimes too\n\nyou feel you can change the past when you can't, you think you can't change the future when you can. you can't change the past or the future, it's only now where the true locus is. the future does have potential, but the future is rooted in the present. there is expectation for the past and the future that is not true\n\ni love solitude. away from mimesis for a bit. monk-like, its like superman’s cave of solitude. to get away from mimesis, away from noise. to find signal again and bring that wisdom back. its like plato cave you gotta leave the cave then go back and help others out. and they are helping you out too. its a collaborative thing i guess\n\ntalk about the importance of framing, how i felt it with psychadelics, use ai to illustrate the notes i made (check keeps). say i did 7 days of research, i saw the importance from the eleucidian mysteries. we cant verify everything from the ground up. begin with the problem not the ground up. verify in proportion to problem importance\n\nare humans a hive mind through time? were like an agar.io bubble that is seperate from other species, we are of life, we are of the universe. we are connected to the first life form, we are not the only life. what is life and consciousness. these are the primordial questions of philosophy. im using a computer which is psychotechnology\n\nis adam smith's invisible hand ethics true? this ties to dunbar's number too. everyone in the world cant be relevant to you, and thats just humanity, theres more life than just us. isnt it life and consciousness that matters? i mean we care about ourselves more, the selfish gene right? there has to be another word. the self-interested gene\n\nim learning the theory of wealth creation, makes decision making clearer and easier, the more principled you are. thats why i learned philosophy for almost a decade, makes living easier when you understand. wow. i can really go from 0 to 1, that would be a really big rite of passage for me. i wanna frame it lol. maybe digitally frame in an nft\n\nwhen you reject authority, you also dont have to trust your self, but trust the machinery that you pilot, to correct errors infinitely. its like l drago, like antifragile. maybe i can talk about book clubs and topics we discuss. antifragile takes mistakes and you become better because of it, even though that sounds cliche, thats how it works i think..\n\ngames are microcosms of life. the symbolic world is full of pattern guides. life is full of patterns. sometimes we see patterns where there arent any underlying. "the map is not the territory" flow can come when you couple tightly the map and territory. we never fully know the territory, due to perception, truth is an asymptote, but we CAN get closer and closer\n\nwhen in doubt, its always going back to basics: health wealth wisdom: sleep diet exercise light relationships, permissionless leverage, code equity media, capital allocation and hiring only s tier people no brainers. wisdom is in truth goodness beauty this is philosophy, the scientific and spiritual (nonphysical nonmental) going to source, oneness, nothingness, truth etc\n\nthis is a test. will this make me a better or worse person? how can i win even if xyz loses? it is only through the tests that hercules becomes himself. there's no other way. memento mori. amor fati. it is only through the obstacles that you find your way. pause and reflect whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority. think big, start small. pragmatic idealogue.\n\nold relationships are strange. you arent the same, theyre not the same. so what was that? just a memory at this point. a past life, you live anew each day. like how avatar has continuity closest with his previous ones, the most recent. you are as the ship of theseus was. was the past real? yes, but does it matter? maybe as much as a dream matters. informative but its not “right now” is it?\n\nold relationships are strange. you arent the same, theyre not the same. so what was that? just a memory at this point. a past life, you live anew each day. like how avatar has continuity closest with his previous ones, the most recent. you are as the ship of theseus was. was the past real?

let results speak for themselves. nuanced utilitarianism: means and ends both matter, the line is somewhat unclear. think about this more. i do not know a lot, i focus on learning and seeking to know the things that are relevant to me. up and up maslows basically. hit from the side\n\nbaby steps. articulate. specify your locus. philosophy is the art of living. flow: clear goals, immediate feedback, challenge-skills balance. dont only steelman the opposition, steelman yourself. be true, good, beautiful. its a constant practice. the art of living, not knowledge, action. sharpening our axe, and cutting w our axe. exponential zone of proximal development. creativity is an infinite resource.\n\ncan you accept religions all together like bahai, with science too? a single unifying religion? a new religion that unites legacy religions and science too. matter and what matters. vervaeke and peterson, stoicism, etc. an open source religion? a place throughout the world for wisdom. science and religion. fitting in the bottom 3 Ps of religion, with the top science. philosophy. wrestling. epistemic humility\n\nis it the experience within the time or the experience of time that you value more? what if you could do everything you could possibly want to do in life, in 1 year, but youd die, vs living a full 100 year life, but only accomplishing / doing half or a third of what you could do? potential vs just mere life? maybe id pick the 1 year of life with all the self-actualization. the experience of time or the moments/actualization WITHIN time?\n\nthe rejection of authority is both scary because it means you have responsibility for yourself and others and potentially the whole universe, but its also reassuring / freeing because you then know that you can solve whatever problem you want, rather that you have the capability to solve whatever problem you want. trial and error. conjecture and criticism is the 1-2 combo that creates explanations that work, which have predictive power, survive criticism, and lead us to making better and better experiments.\n\nthe serenity prayer is so grounding for me. write about infinite being, meaning making, learning from other traditions, ancient wisdom, and other religions, talk about serenity prayer, i believe in the god of spinoza said einstein, i like this, also the more ancient conception of god is like the logos the dao, not personified like a grandpa in the sky, although thats more of a symbol that is on top of the nothingness that vervaeke talks about. some great thinkers suck at articulating in simple terms for the laypeople lol\n\nwrite about how do you live a good life? well what does a bad life look like, is it like vector sum, is life a game full of sub games? is it an adventure disguised as an ordeal? idk. make essays like this, like 100, and grow a garden, v1 v2 etc. improving on what i think was bad about it, and improving it, letting the imperfections guide to a success, an improvement.. entropy is a bitch, we are forever improveable. a good life is probably objective-subjective as music, theres a throughline but wiggle room of subjectivity. calm mind fit body house full of love. healthy wealthy wise. i wanna be wise. ive been told that im wise beyond my years but\n\nI know that God doesn't exist in a scientific way, but can you separate the scientific from the behavioral, the actionable, because in that way, i'm coming around to "believing" in God. Like Jordan Peterson touches on, science tells us how the world IS, but not how to live in it. I’ve also been learning a ton from John Vervaeke about “The Meaning crisis”, and to throw away ancient wisdom / practices / lindy ideas, would be extremely foolish, so let's not do that. Let's see what we can learn from ancient wisdom throughout the ages. It's like we all use different languages to point/refer to the same object/concept (like a water bottle, for example). In the same way, I think most religions and cultures point to the same "spirit". I think it's interesting how religious concepts, values emerge independent of human populations meeting, historically.\n\nPhilosophy is number one in life. With every sense of the meaning of the words I type, currently. I hope to communicate better to others, for social and for personal reasons. I hope other Stanford students can understand. It’s my life, so I guess I can do what I want. Loss aversion makes me think of the ways that when I win, the loss feels double. The tone of my voice isn’t here, it really isn’t. Korea feels like a lost cause now. It was a nice thought though. I just want self sufficiency and peace of mind. I don’t like being jealous. I don’t like the loss of stability from high school. I don’t like feeling disingenuous, seeming to have to do things outside of what you would do normally, to get into prestigious schools, but I guess it’s a really small price to pay. I’ll edit this later, taking away the raw. Hopefully I can preserve the raw, and keep both. This feels good to type away. If only. People write to be concise to readers, it seems. What if I don’t feel like being easily understood, yet I don’t want to be negative. No negativity here, no no. I want to be grateful. I am though. It’s not time yet to double space.\n\nwrite about wanting to be wrong. in a way. it means that you see a more true way than before. it would take foolish consistent pride to stick to the previous lesser understanding of life. better to take the humble incorrectness and use it to learn and be better clean room remove discord from spotify. upgrade adampang write about how the grass always seems greener how do i figure out where im needed?

wordpress is boring, and i dont like dong. i do like jaq and mattia, but since theyre more experienced and professional, i dont want to mess that up with them, i think itd ruin the relationship.. but itd be helping them no? if i can show them that i made something (my own, and testing with dong, and making money all the while, then that could work) but at the same time, i have my own projects and ns internship coming up. so maybe i should say more no, isn't that what i learned from ns?

alan watts naval\n\nlive according to your current best understanding of life\n\nis knowledge emergent? consciousness emergent? same thing?\n\nconsciousness playing with itself. damn what a banger arya\n\nelons philosophy is like deutsch’s made moral and manifest\n\nthe more it is true in breadth, the more it is true in depth\n\nproper understanding washes away anxieties. truth leads to peace\n\nmimesis may work in the long run but not getting to the long run.\n\nsivers' useful not true is kinda like fallabilism and explanations\n\nyou gotta hold seeming contradictions in your head. paradox answers\n\nif its good in its compressed form, itll be fine in its expanded form\n\ngo get enlightened, read sovereign individual and beginning of infinity\n\nthe closer to truth you are, the more of you exist in the multiverse lol\n\na religion of curiosity: understanding wealth life (quantity and quality)\n\ndeutsch is quite socratic in his healthy doubt, hes following fallabilism\n\ntruth is indestructible, there is 1 source.. sounds like a uni maxi oof lol\n\nhedonism is short sighted and blind for the far ranging of the infinite life\n\nthe self is overrated. illusion of mind body duality illusion of seperate self\n\nshared trials and understandings remain for life, like a unifying theory thing\n\nidentity is relative. status is relative. health and wealth are more objective.\n\nfrustration means you are lacking some kind of understanding of how truth works\n\nwisdom is nuance (closer to throughline, invisible calculus, source, logos, dao)\n\nwrite about the god of spinoza naval einstein vervaeke robert spira logos dao JP.\n\ntweet: every life is valuable because in principle every life can make it to infinity\n\nsocrates enzyme of philosophy. constant questioning based on RELEVANCE to how you live\n\nits all relative, we cant take a position from nowhere, did descartes find the position?\n\ni could put so much in bio, self-describers. instead i put my compressed life philosophy\n\nthere is no position from nowwhere, its all relative and related, everything is connected\n\nbe a prime mover* whats wrong with ayn rand again? thiel said her villians were fake? idk\n\ni dont have to believe in a god to use the analogies, i believe in the god of spinoza type\n\nfallabilism: always leave room for better theories. it does not mean “you can never trust”\n\nyou can "die" right now, and be grateful for each bonus day of life. death is a one way door\n\nbone to blood to skin to air to sky to atmosphere to space to infinity, there is no seperation\n\nis there only 1 objective truth but subjective theory conflicts that make it seem more than 1?\n\nbeginning of infinity and soverign individual, through naval and balaji, upgraded my brain hella\n\ntweet we are coming into the new age that nietzsche jung predicted. also with sovereign individual\n\nthere is no 1 second ago, there is no 1 second from now, only now. we die and are born every second\n\nfame is nothing in the face of death and time. even the great names fade in time, thats comforting.\n\nmeaning > happiness. happiness is shallow and temporary, meaning is deep and lasting. soul nourishing.\n\nwere mixing reagents ad random lets be intentional and examine out lives as the great philosophers said\n\nall about truth it connects to peace honesty epistemology. damn naval why you gotta have so many bangers\n\nif this wasnt true then what else waasnt true? thats ontological shock, an overcorrection. grab onto truth\n\ncatch 22s are freeing, if no matter what you do theres poison, its freeing cause now you can pick your poison\n\neverything is connected, we say things are different out of simplicity of talking but everything is connected\n\ncontroversial thinkers like ayn rand and nietzsche usually are incomplete but have good misunderstood thoughts\n\napparently the old conception of God was more like spinoza or dao or logos, not a personified god, no thingness\n\nalong what vectors of life? philosophy wealth creation masculinity diligence/discipline, global tectonic shifts\n\nnot needing a girl or a friend or a thing is as good as having it, and paradoxically its the best market position\n\nis the beginning on infinity the new bible? science and religion reconciled? christian and pagan paraigms reconciled?\n\nnietzsche jung predicted in this new age well have to come up with own values and meaning, i think were solving that.\n\ni love hard lines of whats possible and not whats known and unknown what you want and dont whats knowable and not etc.\n\npaganism and christianity together are correct for darwinian ethics? like shadow integration? and infinite game playing?\n\nwhenever there is a seemingly conflict of theories, there is a hidden unifying theory that is more true than the previous 2+\n\nmeaning is possible without religion* meaning is what people are really after. see vervaeke for this, the components i forgot\n\npower is a neutral force. make a 2x2 of pagan and christian paradigms. be strong and good. also applies to sexual marketplace\n\nthe best ideas recontextualize all preknown ideas. they lever up thought-to-be bedrock and you have to recalculate everything\n\nwhen the final puzzle piece fits in, and the puzzle is complete, now you have a new starting piece. its just one puzzle fractally\n\nget your axioms, your preaxioms, your foundations right first. question the question. omg maybe this is combinatoric bad advice lol\n\ni used to downplay propositional knowledge cause vervaeke, but ive found it can translate to the lower Ps. and can put mind to ease.\n\nwrite about how there is no seperate self, our genes will meet or die. we are but manifestations. fame has a half life. lets build pies. **\n\ndescartes was right in his curiosity wrong in his approach. deutsch says begin with the problem, not the bottom. he questioned the question.\n\nmaybe every habit or piece of your personal history is a value vector: philosophy, soccer, whoop. companies can have their own digital parties\n\ninfinite desire for women is for kids is for life is for the infinite (the god of spinoza, the logos, the dao, the throughline, infinite being)\n\npuzzle pieces make a puzzle, and the completed puzzle itself becomes a puzzle piece to a bigger puzzle lol. works when you zoom in and zoom out.\n\nthe dao dejing and bible etc are explanation attempts. boi is so meta, sovereign individual explains the new age game plan and the tectonic shifts\n\nwhat matters is you want to be good and you actually act on that positive intent and actually get results with better explanations. fallabilism...\n\nevery problem, mistake, error, sin, evil, is a lack of knowledge. seek to be less wrong > seek truth. why does deutsch say this? why the anti-framing?\n\nonly a few amount of books are truly timeless. check your heroes and the books puppeting them, like how everyone is an avatar of a long dead philosopher\n\nmaybe the tic tac toe origami meant the never ending agent arena fittedness. the cosmic beings were another thing. the being before identity/ego was another\n\nis the beginning of infinity the techno-optimist bible? the sovereign individual is the game plan for the new age, the one jung and nietzsche were predicting\n\nthe illusion of seperate self, infinite being of the universe, there is no seperation. write about this and naval and robert spira. naval is a huge hub of spokes for me\n\nin autobio blog post, talk about inflection points like existential crisis and crash course philosophy. talk about each problem and each solution and the thought process\n\ni feel like my philosophy training has been waiting for this miment, ive made the pilgrimage and met the sages. many cults that have to prove their worth theough results\n\nnegative trends are easy to extrapolate, but positive trends are impossible to predict, rather the creation of new knowledge. maybe this is the religious concept of "faith"\n\nan unproblematic state would mean we could not find flow. humans need problems* and we will never run out, but meaning and happiness can be found in constant problem solving\n\nage is a number how many years have you actually lived? and thats just quantity but how much or that quantity was quality? living with clarity calm mind fit body house of love?\n\nok all evils are due to lack of knowledge. does deutsch clarify what an evil is? is it darwinian ethics? and how can i take any example and check if its an evil? like a moral calculator\n\nthe body is part of the mind and nervous system, its all one. humanity is all one. we are a branch of life, just like a repo branch. we are in production and need to remain in production.\n\nteach to the problem, teach salience, mental models, following genuine curiosity based off relevance and salience. what do you want, what SHOULD you want, philosophy ethics, epistemology, etc.\n\nwords are lossy. misunderstanding is the default state. we are all on different plato cave elevator levels, on different vectors, we all have different life stats. life is increasingly an mmorpg\n\nopt in opt out is great. but the way you have options is being strong and good. strong and good = what? what new word for the pagan-christian combined paradigm? hoemath, JP converge on this truth\n\nwhen i notice im thinking about myself too much, i know to look to things beyond me, the meaning purpose question and all. kids, religion, culture, others, the future, these bigger concepts, math\n\nvector sum goal states tie into stoicism locus of control**, you control xyz, truths are the fixed variables, and the goal is always moving, like the golden snitch, it follows the throughline omg\n\nthere is no mindbody seperation that is an illusion, so ofcourse exercise makes your mind feel good. we label for sake of ease of communication but reality is much more nuanced than how we tell it\n\nalso we can reconcile religion with science. learn about ideological vectors, darwinian ethics, and explanatory knowledge wealth life creation from beginning of infinity and the sovereign individual\n\nbe open to upper plato cavemen to help pull you up, and avoid lower plato cavemen from pulling you down (although truths cant be unseen and only overruled with something better, a better explanation)\n\noften solving problems is a good way to gain peace, keeps chaos at bay. literally like war and peace in civ level is like the same on a personal level. there is a war and peace analogy to your life too\n\nif youre prescient from 1st principles, you have a hold on truth, then you act in a way thats aligned with your values and you succeed. if you were omniscient, youd know EXACTLY how to act to get what you want\n\nsometimes people are spokespeople andor practitioners of a great thinker: think speak act, sometimes all in one person sometimes seperate beings of the superorganism lol. like deutsch thought it, naval spoke it.\n\ni dont think religions are real in a matter way, but they are real in a values -> results way. i like this articulation surprised JP didnt articulate it like this. naval defines spiritual as non mental non physical\n\nall heroes gave me pieces of my mental explanatory scaffolding if the world. you can always know the framework of your relevant game, win the game transcend to next game or just stop playing, which is itself a game lol\n\ni wanted to go to online school to escape prison, i didnt want to waste time. i had missing assignments because nothing mattered more than understanding life and philosophy lol. i had ontological shock, that is NO FUCKIN JOKE\n\nwith fallabilism is it that you live by the best theory you have, but are forever opened minded to better theories? and the only time you know if theres room for a better unifying theory is that if theres good competition for it\n\nive been so mistaken, made so many mistakes, all due to a lack of understanding of truth, ive been more wrong, now im much less wrong, but due to fallabilism, were always wrong* just less wrong the more we progress on our theories\n\nfallabilism is like the eye of the needle, dukkha, the invisible calculus. there will always be suffering cause you wont get it right all the time, youre always blind its just a question how blind you are, how high is your resolution\n\nstart with the problem (wow deutsch and elon match), not the first principles of all things. also because learning is all about relevance. relevance is flow too, which is optimal both for learning and meaning in this new godless* age\n\nproblems are theory conflicts. so the prostitution radical experiment touched on the paganism and christian values colliding. now ive begun to reconcile it with darwinian ethics and better explanations via arjun via naval via deutsch\n\nless irrational memes, more rational memes please. is that how knowledge grows? its conjecture and criticism: a guess, and a critique. and experiments verify? popperian epistemology? idk check crash course epistemology popper research again\n\nsocrates talked about transformative truths. if you begin with the problem, any truth through a problem lens is auto-relevant, therefore high flow, therefore high life, and from understanding of truth to action on truth, and results and progress\n\nmeaning making weapth creationn sexual marketplace are great areas of study lol. maslows. progressing along valued vector. its all connected. its all philosophy or something. life is the area of study, of existence. were studying pillars of existence\n\nsay how i tried to dropout of highschool or go to online school back in 2017 or something so i could graduate early. i had tons of missing assignments because i was philosophizing trying to make sense of the world. ive stared into the existential abyss\n\nremember that if someone likes what you have to say, someone else will also dislike it. magnets polarize. magnets both attract and repel. remember that musical notes also dissonate and resonate, depending on what note is with it. i like water, tree, and music analogies.\n\nfallabilism is good but also cartesian doubt, from a practical depression-meaning perspective, and being an athiest, sucks in that way. we still need the God-shaped hole filled. meaning flow, purpose. progress along vectors. problem solving with understanding and action diligence\n\nyou get better at anything with practice, as you get closer to source, you dont need as much time learning, skills and concepts and learnings transfer over if youre learning source right, everything is a manifestation of the spirit, the throughline, logos, dao, the god of spinoza\n\n"on your dying day, youd give everything for another day?" well what about dont die? i mean death is a one way door i could kill myself now if i wanted to. we all can. some even do. above all give me truth, insert into the wild pic. but material things can help enable life beyond me.\n\nthere is a moral imperitive to knowledge wealth and life creation. deutsch tied together philosophical schools into our current theory of everything* made optimism a theory. and its actually true wow. gotta understand the book with repitition just like zero to one. thiel took a girardian take.\n\nare there objectively more wise people than others? im not convinced that renunciation works, even the buddha tried it and renounced renunciation. thats part of why siddartha was such a good book, he tried all the things, learned from mistakes, was childlike in the best way, and lived many lives in one life.\n\ndont die would be great for the great people of the past. humanity would be greater if they were still alive. pick your favorite people. or how about loved ones? you actually believe in it because you dont kill yourself. camus said the "meaning of life" is whatever stops yourself from killing yourself lol. pretty true\n\ndescartes started with the ground up, maybe out a problem idk. elon started with the problem THEN the ground up of THAT ground. deutsch says begin with the problem. elon says teach to the problem. its so great to learn from others lives and you save ttime THROUGH them. learn from their errors and piggyback, leapfrog etc\n\nim learning the theory of wealth creation, makes decision making clearer and easier, the more principled you are. thats why i learned philosophy for almost a decade, makes living easier when you understand. wow. i can really go from 0 to 1, that would be a really big rite of passage for me. i wanna frame it lol. maybe digitally frame in an nft\n\nwhen in doubt, its always going back to basics: health wealth wisdom: sleep diet exercise light relationships, permissionless leverage, code equity media, capital allocation and hiring only s tier people no brainers. wisdom is in truth goodness beauty this is philosophy, the scientific and spiritual (nonphysical nonmental) going to source, oneness, nothingness, truth etc\n\nknowledge -> wealth -> life -> knowledge (explanations in your mental scaffolding) does it model the world better or worse? let results speak for themselves. nuanced utilitarianism: means and ends both matter, the line is somewhat unclear. think about this more. i do not know a lot, i focus on learning and seeking to know the things that are relevant to me. up and up maslows basically. hit from the side\n\nevery yes is a bet, every no is a fold. be proud of both. good decisions dont dwell on past plays. poker is a pretty great microcosm of life too. music is social symbolism of 1 sense. sport is social exercise and a game which is a microcosm of life. i think verratti is right: soccer is just a game, life is the bigger game. there is no seperation of self that is the grand illusion. feel together with infinite being\n\nso socrates was highly rational? he had socratic dialogos with himself in a way. do you NEED another being? i dont think NEED but it can help, and also hurt. but back to dao de jing: a bad man is a good mans job, a good man is a bad mans teacher. lots of wisdom in that book fosho. write about books i like, rate how much ive digested it, how much i like it, give a range or say ish. audible, documents, from influences""\n\ntrying to be perfect is a fools errand, obviously dont try to make mistakes but be willing to for the sake of progress. as long as youre net positive thats all that matters, try to maximize net positivity, nuanced utilitarianism. life is orchestration. putting out bad fires and lighting the right good fires. its like yin yang, theres always gonna be some yin in your yang, we are always wrong its just a question of how wrong we are. act in proportion to how wrong you are about something. tbd\n\nthe serenity prayer is so grounding for me. write about infinite being, meaning making, learning from other traditions, ancient wisdom, and other religions, talk about serenity prayer, i believe in the god of spinoza said einstein, i like this, also the more ancient conception of god is like the logos the dao, not personified like a grandpa in the sky, although thats more of a symbol that is on top of the nothingness that vervaeke talks about. some great thinkers suck at articulating in simple terms for the laypeople lol\n\ndid deutsch write the bible for the new age? he made a theory of everything basically that combines epistemology ethics wealth creation etc etc. he made it so epistemology and ethics, 2 long standing subschools of thought in philosophy, are becoming less and less seperate. were getting closer to source less wrong people! gotta love it. create knowledge share it. create wealth share it. create life share it. religion of curiosity. science technology. but also we gotta include morality and flowmaking meaningmaking ancient wisdom etc, but truth above all\n\nfrugality is a virtue, of people and businesses. be pragmatic idealogues, if you dont have a goal beyond yourself, you will be self obsessed and depressed. when i notice i think about myself too much, i try to consciously shift focus and salience to more important things beyond me. even with dont die entropy could still get me. im just grateful for life, existence, consciousness. life is a gift, a chance at consciosuness. death will be like prebirth, nothingness.but the concept of an afterlife is like how life goes on, the superorganism. is there a way to mate with other species? rn we can only mate with humans lol. which ones we like? dolphins maybe and octopi are the smartest others.\n\npain is in proportionate to how innacurate your mental explanatory scaffolding is. you cant unsee truths, truths are indestructible (JP tries to philosophize with a hammer like nietzsche) but can you spell nietzsche??? filtering function for my kind of person lol. omg and better truths overrule past truth perceptions, just like my bedrock gets levered and it recontextualizes everything, and with the brain compression to the back of the brain, theres more space more peace more possibility with more working memory and brain space. how much data can we store? 2.6 petabytes? thats plenty. its kinda crazy how much info humans can remember, and i still have more neurons coming online till 25 or so so thats cool. damn arjun so good id bet on that guy, id use incorporated man on him, but how do you tie it to personal income etc.  **\n\npsychadelics did open my mind but im not crazy or anything its more like my mind is a tunnel and psychadelics are like scaffolding within the tunnel that keeps it open to new ideas and things instead of narrowing with depression or something idk. it was a one way positive decision. definitely memorable. if the prostitution problem haunts me: i need a grand ultimate theory of ethics to make sense of it because the experience catalyzed a conflict of ideas, conflict of theories that i dont know exactly how to reconcile well maybe my conjecture of reconciling paganism with christian paradigms: strong and powerful. promiscuous but a good father and coparent. men just want novel sex but i like you as a person were hardwired for it, but if you meet a man whos more of a soulmate or something go for it. love comes and goes but coparenting never ends and i WANT to sign up to be a father i want to make babies w you lol. i love kids. ill be fuckin easy to work with. ill be powerful and good, a philosopher king. i seek power i seek truth i seek goodness i seek beauties i seek meaning\n\n
