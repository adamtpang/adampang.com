ethics is about good and evil, and therefore life and death

i see both sides, sometimes going harder or going softer is the way.

a "dead player" can be following a high-quality script that usually works, but it's still fragile / static\n\nOn death, on caring about people, on meeting people that are now dead, and not caring.

the first rules we need to establish before even playing the infinite game infinite through time and space\n\nthe illusion of seperate self, infinite being of the universe, there is no seperation.

remember deutschian lens and will to live.\n\n"i have been dead for 18 billion years, i am alive for a blink of an eye, and i will be dead again?"\n\ntalk about what virtue is required for this moment.

arrive at non arrival.\n\nthe more you feel awe, and feeling small, it makes you feel small, in a good way, all the worries and anxieties wash away with the awe.\n\nyou can go far with a simple long life.

advice cancels to zero, but wealth can be positive sum of course, we do more with less, lest were still cavemen

if garry tan says theres too much money in the world + thiel's communism no idea conspiracy.

on Feb 7, 2025 at 11:30 AM - 12:00 noon\n\nlife is infinitely flawed, but that means there is infinite opportunity to improve, IF we generate the right knowledge to do so, through conjecture and criticism.

need atleast 2-1 asymmetric risk profile\n\nis there only 1 objective truth but subjective theory conflicts that make it seem more than 1?\n\ngood and evil is of kind, power and powerlessness are of degree.

+ the ancients touched on / pointed to, the timeless.\n\nlets question long standing cultural beliefs to make sure they have solid rational ethical epistemelogical philosophical grounds\n\nwhen you feel off.

why?\n\na new worldview is almost as good as a new world\n\ninfinite knowledge infinite wealth infinite life\n\nfrom the depths, you see the path to the heights\n\nthe observed self is not the observing self.

go back to deutsch book + my autobio + current life problem situation for advice from ai like a therapist watch avatar and sopranos and breaking bad analyses death and music are the only things that are real.

learn about ideological vectors, darwinian ethics, and explanatory knowledge wealth life creation from beginning of infinity and the sovereign individual\n\nsolution to narrow utilitarianism: nuanced utilitarianism = means and ends both matter.

the unexamined life is not worth living

evil is often insidious, not upfront

socrates was always like: "but how is that relevant TO YOU?"

the more material wealth, the more life possible, remember that humans are both matter and what matters.

music tech philosophy\n\nwrite about the god of spinoza naval einstein vervaeke robert spira logos dao JP.\n\nlove is seeing yourself in something else and wanting to complete the unity of it\n\nbullshit is when salience is decoupled from truth.

i see both sides, sometimes going harder or going softer is the way.

"time will tell"\n\ngreat things start from small things, everyone was a baby haha\n\nthere are no epistemological, moral, or aesthetic authorities.\n\nif you want to be given everything, you must give everything up\n\nthe symbolic world is the map.

ethics\n\nbeing wrong sucks for results, but is great for truth-seeking.\n\nConvictions are in proportion to how you can't break the idea.\n\n"what you are seeking, is seeking you." schelling point shit..\n\nthe timeless things are only found in time..

**\n\npsychadelics did open my mind but im not crazy or anything its more like my mind is a tunnel and psychadelics are like scaffolding within the tunnel that keeps it open to new ideas and things instead of narrowing with depression or something idk.

there will always be suffering cause you wont get it right all the time, youre always blind its just a question how blind you are, how high is your resolution\n\nstart with the problem (wow deutsch and elon match), not the first principles of all things.

the best areas are the frontier, with no map, and you need correct axioms to derive first principles solutions where there are no easy answers

its like earths a computer and humanity is an ml model with opponent processing, gradient descent, cell blockout.

spend more time on the timeless and not the temporary\n\nthe most contrarian thing of all is to think for yourself, not oppose the crowd\n\nfrustration means you are lacking some kind of understanding of how truth works\n\nproduct is more important than sales.

solving problems.\n\nIf it does not break physics, it is possible If it is possible, it’s up to our creation of knowledge via conjecture and criticism to come up with the good explanations for us to solve the problem\n\nalso we can reconcile religion with science.
