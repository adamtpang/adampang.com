why i like network states. the implications for fast and iteratable laws. good for mars, good for nuclear.

network states can have minimal law, passport benefits, some kind of taxation and benefits from diff companies

how would a real network state look like? like a paid monthly passport, benefits of being a part, vetted.

what if states or countries merged? could they?, or break in 2 or 3

balaji made a good point, decentralized earning and freedom of speech. if you cant speak, someone is your master wtf

JP advocates for responsibility, but id say the step before responsibility is empowering yourself: learning and permissionless leverage, and experimenting to find your own personal frontier way"\n\n
