what's worse than porn? Pr0n. mwahaha iykyk

here's my daily process:

1) i write tons of new ideas in google keeps

2) i have a note with my routine in it:

- delete stuff

- coffee

- make sure i get protein + veggies

- IF whoop green: exercise (see "sports" post)

- clear calendar as much as I can JUST for today

- double inhales (check andrew huberman)

- serenity prayer

- comparrow (an eisenhower matrix app i made) (will appear in my digital store eventually)

3) so the TLDR for the whole process is: notes -> comparrow -> calendar -> then i just do the stuffs

...

only work hard if its got legit meaning to it. otherwise, i prefer diligence and 8020 steps
is startup school like a school alt?
leverage and tools working for you while you sleep

8020 baby steps. clear goals, immediate feedback, challenge-skills balance

build the lever to then pull

i like a clear clarity plan. clear goals, immediate feedback, challenge skills balance

scaling down the task so perfectionism is easy to beat. minimal good release

public drafts, no more embarassing stuff, polish 1 thing, keep a ratio of polished and unpolished, thats a good idea

do less

substance not time, principles

resource allocation. what is your lowest resource? time, energy, stress, skill, money, location, relationships? resource transformations?

just do more with less


the fastest way to do something is to not do it at all

its gotta click in my mind

venn diagram to your goals

if its not relevant to you, drop it

do bubble sort first, then get to quicksort. just get started. aim for speed and volume at first, let the perfectionist in late

breadth then depth then breadth then depth ad infinitum

sometimes spreading yourself out with ADHD-like novelty builds motivation and connecting across domains, if it is true between A and B, its a deeper truth than either

put scapple in tools


generate: speed and volume
curate: if there is doubt there is no doubt
excavate: push it to others

import all "@"keeps. gotta distill too

add some, remove some. or a lot

positive constraints

remove bad indiehack ideas i wouldnt use

after cleaning, point to best blog posts on twitter

words first. courage speech vision all in one. action. writing is thinking, no? its clarity-smithing

i like the bryan johnson way, like just follow the data. if the means gives better data outcomes, then sure, do that, but if not, ill stick to this

results validate

you dont need to write down self-reminding tasks: brush teeth, do laundry, wash dishes

how can you build leverage in the best/fastest/cheapest unit of effort per unit time?

seperate doubts from surefire posts. i can always add back

go as fast as you can, in a way you can do for a long time. prep for the marathon, sprint when you can


public categorized notes to self and others. like a half blood prince notebook for others a cheatsheet

positive constraints

curation makes it easier to sift. imagine a chef that curates menu a writer that curates their essays a musician that curates their songs etc.

show routine:

color code the store: project, pain killer, vitamin

if i was running a show, id want to plan the whole thing out, then actually manifest it with clear vision, and to not get bored, id do a ton of em

you still need to work but leverage first

curate when theres clearly too much generation


how much would elon pay to do all the same things, but he would feel half the stress?

leverage is anything where 1 decision actuates without you

getting a job is permissioned
every transaction is permissioned?
time management

just do 1 step. make the goals clear, immediate feedback (pat pat), challenge skills balance. do it the easy way, but go long on this path, be durable and endure. spread the stress over time

if an ADHD tries to focus on 1 thing that they dont want to, they get 3/10 done. if they just do what they want, including sometimes that task, it'll be at least 5/10 done. it's the variety that catalyzes momentum/motivation

just ship it. you have a plan, you can sense utility/value. make it, sell it, share it

talking should compliment action, not substitute it. so as long as i oscillate / balance it, no worries. if not, i DO have reason to worry. be honest. product and sales.

work hard only if you got to. working hard costs more energy and stress and time, its all about allocation to the invisible calculus

solve problems, own the solution, leave a trail of leveraged solutions

whats the simple elegant solution?

i prefer diligent, smart, wise work > hard work

do it at speed volume cheap relevant. what i want to do.

just do it shittily, ask questions, be relevant, dont prep just talk.


positive constraint

if you can ignore the solution, it wasnt a big problem

do not destroy the means of error correction

balance learning and doing

what do you want, what are the bottlenecks

keep talking about things relevant to me, till ive said what i wanted to say

exercising with others has accountability built in, and its much more motivating in the long run. same with working. cafes can be a bummer though. its so much easier to work when others are working around you. the social context matters so much psychologically

consolidate files / posts

i see things in pipelines, like supply chains / logistics / bottlenecks. so creation, curation, execution is its own chain. i need to execute more.

for every

talk about procrastination

plan learn build show tell

delete by topic first, add new ones. color code based on how ready they are. add relevant emojis to each title, shorten titles

fulfill social commitments: JR and aydin gokce, then meta commitments from keeps

if you can ignore the solution, it wasnt a real problem

unfinished projects are like unfinished books. its okay. just return to it when you need to. you dont HAVE to force discipline and all that. i like discipline and diligence over the long haul, project management and cooperating with your past present and future selves, over time, with different frames and frame breaks, when discipline makes sense, youll know deep down

so the daily game is. 1 blog post, 1 commit

delete the weird blogs

be useful

take moonshots and regular shots.


why im doing it shitty on purpose. ill clean later. procrastination history

color note by green yellow red, which essays are more polished than others. talk about that in the format. balance quantity and quality. but quality THROUGH quantity

just focus on volume rn, dont edit, just post

i can always transfer content to wherever else

color code quality

talk about my productivity system

right now just post a ton. do 100 thing MO

you can get to good answers by saying no to bad, and whatever youre left with. you can also say yes to things you think are good. generate curate excavate,

immediate relevance is great for flow

with any creation like code or media, make it super easy to do, for yourself. simplify

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Soq4gD4tFQM_lxIe3fIgMntYnobHt92V4cAydrqUJnA/edit

clean up text when more than a page, when i have to scroll

if i feel theres too much noise, publish 1, delete 2. if not enough signal, publish 2, delete 1. nah

my productivity workflow, dont trust me

sometimes its simply a lack of procedural knowledge

talk about sabatier, link to casey and s3. figure out the jekyll thing

ethical productive incentive design from the beginning, im realizing, is super important in certain areas

curation is where choice is easier

give me the cheatsheet

could this bite me in the butt? does this create anxiety sharing? is this evergreen? just archive and gitignore, dont delete

immediate feedback: git commits / shipping, sales is feedback. talking to users. question delete optimize accelerate automate

do 100 of something, and once i reach that, THEN im allowed to be a perfectionist. oscillate the process, and be mindful about what mode im in. experiment mode, then edit mode.

do more with less and sell that, esp if you have specific knowledge

deutsch lowkey exemplar, also noah kagan. map out the connections between them all

comparrow all the blog post titles, then

write a what to work on roadmap:
important problems, solutions, team. join or make own? learn skills. generate curate excavate/execute
what are the implications

excellence through being prolific * high taste * bold sales.

find a team or make one


it should look delusional on the surface, but if you have gotten through the first principles idea maze, youre golden. if you have good reason to know this will work, and you have a mission and you know what variables to manipulate to achieve your goal state

so ill only focus on code and media till i have the money i want? then what? thats a great question. scapple this

Putting it All Together
Prioritize Scalable Ventures: Focus on building the blog and indie hacking store, as these offer scalability and align with Naval’s advice on permissionless leverage.
Selective Learning: Consider the additive concrete home training if it adds a valuable skill to your portfolio. Weigh the GTA software job against its potential for learning and networking.
Minimize Distractions: Derek’s advice to simplify means only taking on freelance gigs or day jobs if they are directly aligned with your long-term goals.
Long-Term Impact: Keep Peter Thiel’s and Elon Musk’s focus on big-impact projects in mind. Choose ventures that can lead to significant breakthroughs in your field.
Financial Discipline: Pay down your debt following Dave Ramsey’s baby steps, but don’t let the need for immediate cash flow deter you from pursuing high-growth opportunities.

list future project ideas and show whats pending vs finished. redo comparrow and sell on store

not the input of work, what is the output of the work, and own the solution of that output, to solving a problem you identify.

instead of "phone, say text" add telegram?


library kids: elon, bill gates, naval, visa. reading purist NAH. check my store for pdf to mp3

small experiments. just see if x will work, have a backup plan. fearset shit.

if i can ignore the solution, its not a problem

fearset shit: define prevent repair base hit inaction cost

if someone has done it, you know from 1st principles its possible. but if no example, you gotta do the first principles calculus to be sure of the solution derivation

if you dont wanna do it, dont do it. do something else in the same vein

shitty firsts gets you into the game, better than perfectionistic nothingness

i get motivation if i actually like to do the thing, its immediately relevant, and i actually believe in it. it has a clear purpose for doing.

i should label is this raw vs cleaned up. color code. hide what i doubt?

blueprint should have a spreadsheet with all interventions and costs, then we can sort by cost and you can do it on whatever budget youre on. but also 8020 analyze

lets write first but
what is are the criteria for how ill edit each node, or delete nodes, and ill just add nodes, do i categorize them? tag em?

the blogging and podcast ideas energizes me. i gotta code though too for the network state. lets walk through townhall. what would i use it for? just talking about guam? go for volume and speed and relevance, edit later

writing and talking must be complements to action, not substitues. accountability owning a leveraged solution to a great problem noone sees coming. this is prediction and building upon axioms

start podcast. how can it be easy remotely?

how will you allocate your time, money, stress, dopamine?

you can prioritize being low stress first. maybe working hard is lazy in a way, because if theres lack of clarity, youre compensating with "hard work" which is socially acceptable

i love scapple, add to tools and show cgrome extensions

make markdown spacing better w pandoc

fix the mantras spacing. fix pandoc

"chat with me" calendly

make a "tools" blog post, show chrome extensions, and other tools like sortmymusic, playlist miner

Tips for Using Markdown
Headings: Use # for main titles and ## or ### for subheadings.
Lists: Use - or * for bullet points and 1. for numbered lists.
Emphasis: Use *italic* or **bold** for emphasis.
Links: Create hyperlinks with [link text](URL).
Images: Add images with ![alt text](image URL).

maybe writing online in markdown aint a good idea idk:

find a better way for markdown formatting and line break stuff. pandoc should do better

show the chrome extensions i use

check if pandoc can do links and pics

if i add pics to markdown, will that work? scapple pics, pics i want
what else?

fix the calendly
