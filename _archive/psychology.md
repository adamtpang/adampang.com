so are humans cold incentive-following creatures? including me, including you

mixed motivations autorationalize?

why do we want attention?

why do humans want attention? its sales?
moves, like tech, but GOT?

after a while, people repeat the same things.

jung, freud, adler

prostitution, guma' uritao, taboos, the shadow, the sopranos

vice signalling is stronger and builds more trust than virtue signalling

why is attention seeking seen as bad? it feels shallow

religion appeals to psychological needs

relationships are built on bids for attention, and those bids met

does jealousy propel our species? status. positive sum wealth. well is it true?

sharing online, dunbar's number, combinatorial explosion, and seeing people as objects, because you must at some point




now that i understand the system, i dont feel so bad about failing to reach a goal state i previously desired. now i know the reasons.

when i notice the twitter feed doesnt have cool stuff, i know we gotta build more solutions to great problems. own the lever. press a button, huge effect. where judgement comes. allow for meritocracy that fucks you up

energy emotions buttons

write about permissionlessness and gatekeepers
go through side gates, build a better gatebreaker

essay on star farms, network states, sabatier machines, and bitcoin mining

mixed motivations autorationalize?

if youre depressed, the way out is clear goals immediate feedback and challenge skills balance. they call depression anti-flow for a reason. so the 3 constituants of flow aint a bad place to start

big 5
focus on my high openness then because thats where im an extreme person

why i like network states. the implications for fast and iteratable laws. good for mars, good for nuclear.

technology is doing more with less, which leads to more room for more people, more life, status automatically curates

why do we want attention?

does jealousy propel our species? status. positive sum wealth. well is it true?

why do i watch others to find what i think? why cant i think for myself on these topics? i guess if i trust a thinker, he can give me thoughts for free, that fit snuggly on my existing framework of the world. if a frame is wrong, you must let it turn to water.

religion appeals to psychological needs

myths contain messages not doctrins

you always understand more than you are able to speak

does everybody have a suicide threshold? an amount of pain that is unbearable. on the flip side, does everybody have a sword they can arm themselves with against that? meaning to keep you going religiously?

im a future scapegoat

hedonic treadmill. so meaning. you wont find a satisfying propositional answer. its about how, feel, play

thiel says psychology is a poor substitute for religion

you can have multiple motivations to do something. like how ill play badminton cause its a novel exercise, its social, and its good IG fuel. why IG? social validation

why do humans want attention? its sales?
moves, like tech, but GOT?

damn tech makes me think in sociopathic ways sometimes

quirks
- i pat myself twice whenever i see myself doing something long term good. self-rewarding skinner style

psychadelics
- terrrence mckenna
- one high dose psilocybin
- its not a panacea, set and setitng really do matter
- import notes
- i researched for a week. its safe, its a whole other category of drug
- its the nuclear of psychonautics (can be super useful, terrible PR)

one of the sucky things about atoms is that you need cash to get started for the audacious projects, not tryna make excuses, just noting the difference between bits. but the world will change

instead of "phone, say text" add telegram?

software isnt the end game, hardware is.
