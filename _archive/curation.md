i want to delete parts of this blog, but i know that getting volume out at the start is important

curation is good though because i can trim off the noise, clean it up, and make it easier for readers to sift through (theres so much on the internet)

right now i just gotta aim for output

like i gotta consolidate these blog posts. some should just be a paragraph on a main blog post, not a seperate blog post.speed, volume, curation

twitter curate my tweets

speed volume curation

so i learned that alongside speed and volume, minimalist curation. dont give people bullets, leave the best of the competency
