check out ray dalio's economiic machine vid on youtube

also Milei in Argentina is an experiment i'm paying attention to, he's interesting as a character

i wanna watch more videos on him on youtube, but it's in spanish, which makes me want to make an ai translation app, that connects a service like heygen / proprietary, with youtube. in the form of a chrome extension or something, and put it on my digital store, indiehacking style yo

also game theory ties into it. its pretty crazy that von neumann just created game theory

we talk about GTO a lot in poker lol
its supply demand. being paid whatt youre worth for a problem

labor capital/equity media code. rental income automated manufacturing
building the lever that youll pull

you pay for the raw materials and the transformations configurations

capitalism communism and feature of the universe. talk about how you cant change the shape of the power law, only traverse it or change its size. better to rise and increase it. thats the only known ethical way


focus on building the expensive things that are needed, like housing and defense

no full solutions, only tradeoffs. but positive sum trades

you can traverse or change the size of the power law. former is status, latter is wealth. size-changing

its like the ethics of the invisible hand. selfish interest that leads to postive outcomes for others. thats good incentive design

idk if this is right, but i think getting rid of a minimum wage and instead focus on reskilling resources. but if it can be taught, theres still competition, but tons of needed roles, no? apprenticeships

capitalism is an/THE engine of economic growth

free markets are error correcting for under over allocation

every transaction is positive sum no? the buyer thinks this thing in front of them is worth the price, and the seller things this thing is worth letting go for the price. they both think its the right decision, FOR THEM. people have different needs

continuous learners in free markets

what other leverage is there? besides code media capital labor?

if you tax the rich and pay the poor, thats the same thing as printing money and giving to poor. printing money is artificially carving out social credit points, and giving to whoever you give, it dilutes the existing pool's value and redirects it to wherever

i like figuring out the microeconomics of projects because i does nt lie, and implications excite

total value
barrier to entry

equity is a form of leverage. kinda the inverse of capital. you can start with 100% leverage

you can traverse or change the size of the power law. former is status, latter is wealth. size-changing

this ties to dunbar's number too. everyone in the world cant be relevant to you, and thats just humanity, theres more life than just us. isnt it life and consciousness that matters? i mean we care about ourselves more, the selfish gene right?

nudge people toward the invisible calculus.\n\nif we raise the ceiling, demand for the floor increases, which makes floor-projects economically feasible\n\nmoney is neutral, you can buy bombs, you can buy food and shelter and pay the bills and infrastructure etc.\n\nmy time price is based on 3 factors: the demand on my time, the supply of my time, and how much i need the cash\n\nevery transaction is a mutual agreement. zero coercion. both sides perceive the transaction to be positive for em\n\nattention economies, time economies, memetic economies, like music, philosophy (ideas), moneymaking, sexual marketplaces..\n\n- the ethics of capitalism is pretty cool cause since purchases are opt-in / non-coercive, they‚Äôre therefore morally sound.\n\nif money is a societal IOU, as a result of distributed problem-solving, uncoerced creativity, and free trade, how is that bad?\n\nwhy is there inflation and money printing AT ALL? should it be max the gdp growth? elon said something about if it exceeds something\n\nan economy is like setting up for a party, don't do what others are already doing, leave people that are best at XYZ to keep doing XYZ\n\nthe economics of it dont seem too good idk, it seems really hard to have a long lasting way to capture people's attention and monetize it\n\nmoney/ a dollar is like ownership of social credits. the number of fiat units are the nuance, the granularity, the decimal pointage of the ownership.\n\nwrite about wealth creation and capitalism like setting up for a party. in capitalism you sow specifically, reap generally. free trade is natural to humans\n\nvalue is an abstracted thing in a sense w money, the real economy is exchange of goods and services, but people miss that this applies to digital goods and services\n\nis inflation important, could a network state set their currency to print 2% forever. should every rule be variable or should some be constant forever from the start\n\ntalk about a case for capitalism: every blog post will have a read time next to it based on word count, and show viewcount, and i can tag by topic, just like a tweet.\n\ncapitalism sows individually and reaps with plurality, but you gotta find your economic optima genuine to you and without competition and of sufficient value to live off of\n\npeople should practice creating wealth without the money part, just pure barter or nothin at all idk, so that you understand what is wealth and how its different from money\n\neconomics is like a study of what people want and need, and how to give it to them. based on your role, your unique location, knowledge, connections, hard skills, soft skills, etc.\n\n3 maybe my time is better spent to serve them in another way, create wealth for all of society, and the 50 bucks they make that day will go further due to increasing wealth creation as a species\n\nso everything turns into commodity? you get money by making a commodity? creativity 0 to 1, then 1 to n, then high supply means cheaper, so everyone gets a raise.. everyone is a producer and consumer..\n\neconomics is about being useful. building something that others cant, and they pay you. i feel like i have a good understanding of the building blocks of creating wealth. but i gotta code and write more.\n\nthe price of people and products, in the free market, is determined by supply and demand. become low supply through venn-combinatorics. combining what you are natural at. become high demand by solving top problems.\n\ndo i work on efficient market hypthosis? the most expensive part in the chain? thatd be housing. so increase supply. cover, icon, mudbots. also regulation, so network states. OR do i work on the foundations of the chain or the new links in the chain?\n\nwrite about the diff kinds of markets, the reputation in a market (like preselection) and supply and demand in markets. link to huberman for dopamine, deutsch popper and baldwin effect in ideas, orion taraban for genes, naval for wealth, singapore lky balaji for jurisdiction.\n\npart of the thesis is that even min wage jobs have a such a high bar to pay for value. so what skillsupply does is gets the integral of the economic calculus higher def. theres so much low hanging fruit. we just gotta connect people with problems with people who are the solution\n\ntheory of money-making. what are the "first principles"? someone has to give you money. why would they give you money? this is the theory of value. my friend athon brought up this concept i cant unsee. top down incentives, and bottom up emergence. think music scenes and adam smith's invisible hand.\n\nmoney is a societal iou, so if you do someone a favor, charge for it, offer it in the market, and then you give the iou to other people that do you market favors.. and if we keep doing things better, the margins get better and shit.. lots of people dont know how to code, so youre doing them a favor..\n\nmaybe i can write about how nspals is most crypto, and i didnt really understand it, but from popperian epistemology, and austrian economics, im understanding the theoretical and practical utility of cryptocurrencies, its not just a scam, its actually a moral good lol.
