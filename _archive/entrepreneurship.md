go through side gates, build a better gatebreaker

problem -> solution -> sell -> build


PERMISSIONLESS LEVERAGE
media: blog, youtube, tiktok, twitter, email, book, spotify, podcast
code: indiehacking

new jobs are created just like new companies are created. some will stick around for certain times

i respect atom-entrepreneurs fosho, i just wanted to build leverage first. felt like the better first move

own a leveraged solution to a great problem

needs to be advanced cause small scale

startup ideas should pass filters, and if you can try to break the idea and it lasts, you gotta do it. are you actually motivated to make it? can you make it? does it actually solve a problem? would you use it? do you believe in it? are you building something that you cant buy? if you are building what already exists, are you just going to undercut?

labor. cut down this forest. you can leave
capital. allocate to this company. leave it alone
code. code this app, servers run it
media. post this content, servers run it


if your idea is already built, thats a good thing, the world has that thing. keep looking out for new good problems to solve. up and up the tech stack!

its ok to do software first, even elon did it

talk about positioning high demand low supply through combinatorics. be naval authentic

be a multipreneur to practice meta orchestration


i dont ask for money, ask for advice. only ask for money when accelerating. when you've exhausted all no-money experiments for what youre trying to do.

Peter Thiel

Derek Sivers

Naval Ravikant

talk about how its okay to start with zip2 first. elon and adcock both do it. there are good permissionless leverage reasons why starting with software before energy gas manufacturing can be a good decision.

i couldn't find a job so i made some

what if im into saas AND hardtech? am i allowed to exist? lol

talk about how code and media is leverage, where even with a small value add, it scales mega. like elon said. you can start with small value huge quantity, andor huge value small quantity.


i mean i wanna do like what elon did and get wealthy with code (permissionless leverage like naval says, along with media to build relationships at scale, like david senra pointed out), then i can work in the atom-tech thats foundational like energy gas manufacturing housing

1,1,so heres the money early game: write and code. then i can go for energy gas manufacturing. like elon, software first. and heres why: software and media are permissionless leverage, then i can get capital and labor for permissioned labor, but i can allocate and use my judgement. software has no marginal cost of replication, so as long as i provide value with my code or media, itll spread like wildfire (at least i hope so). an audience and a reputation is accountable skin in the game

its pretty good to be an entrepreneur or vc because you gotta put your resources where your mouth is, and you got skin in the game

funding is leverage/acceleration

23:24 Raising capital is seen as a way to run experiments that can't be done without it; founders should first exhaust all possible low-cost experiments.

say i used to jailbreak everyones iphones in highschool with cydia, ran a small candy arbitrage business, made 20 bucks a day

buy what you cant build, build what you cant buy

i like thiel because hes both a philosopher and a capitalist

i fuckin love noah kagan, hes so honest, fun, hes successful, hes living proof you dont need to be xyz all lined up. "wife quest" lol

when i notice the twitter feed doesnt have cool stuff, i know we gotta build more solutions to great problems. own the lever. press a button, huge effect. where judgement comes. allow for meritocracy that fucks you up

i feel like when i get my first stripe / lemon squeezy payments, imma cry

are there more leverage ways than labor capital code and media? its just anything where judgement is a lever so it works while youre not attending to it. BUT you need to actually solve people's problems to provide value to your fellow human. and with media, that builds a reputation and trust with people (so called audience)

buy what you cant build, build what you cant buy

going for first internet dollar lol. never giving up\n\njust ship it. you have a plan, you can sense utility/value. make it, sell it, share it\n\nblack coffee is my nzt127 or whatever the number is. going from starving artist to wealthy artist\n\nfounders are artists that don't starve.\n\ndiff between founder and employee is agency\n\nhower first dollar do things that dont scale\n\nexecution = you actually build it and sell it\n\nif 90% of startups fail, then if i make 10 startups..\n\nevery startup is a bold guess in the free wealth market\n\nmake a job autoapplyer? nah be an entrepreneur. indiehacker\n\nthe only reason to do a startup is to build what you cant buy\n\nthere are startup ideas hidden in your biggest monthly expenses.\n\nno bullshit. build and sell. code equity media. then capital labor\n\n"buy indiepage, and that will be my am site instead, entrepreneur resum…"\n\nentrepreneurs are like scientist philosopher sages generals almost, all in one lol\n\ndavid senra makes content about founders. i can do it too with cool company showcases.\n\nteach what i know about programming and entrepreneurship? be an entrepreneur first lol\n\nelon doesnnt focus on business plans because when the plan hits reality its always wrong*\n\nindiehacking fits in navals permissionless leverage wealth creation explanatory framework\n\nget income asap. solve top problems which generates value, then capture some of that value\n\nWhat’s missing in the world? With a prepared mind, i can generate startup ideas organically\n\nstartup ideas are found in s tier books, your monthly burn, learning and noticing, what else?\n\nclean room, sell clothes to fashion things on guam in bulk (do a if there is doubt no doubt thing)\n\nif your business ideas suck and dont motivate you. remember that you can come up with more. over time\n\ni feel more like a founder in training. ceo in training. the best way to learn is to do? i mean i guess..\n\nthe “who you know” has “what they know” included in that. but build something great and the market will come\n\nbuild free tools, see if theres usage, get testimonials, then just charge to keep it going, server costs etc.\n\nthere are different flavors/styles/genres of founders. i wonder what they are all similar and different in/at\n\ni see value everywhere now, i see startup ideas everywhere when something goes wrong i can think of a solution\n\nall it takes is one creation to point to and validate the whole portfolio. (we know about blastar and zip2 for example)\n\ni want wealth creation: internet businesses/products, marketing, first internet dollar, no debt, savings and investments\n\nsolve the top problem for me, then help other people with that same top problem do the same. monetize through code / media.\n\ncan i find 1 receptive person w the problem? then keep doubling, and for first 10 people, giving for free, first 100, 50% off\n\nyou dont know what the market will like until you launch. you can only know what you like, pre-launch. guaranteed market of 1.\n\nnot the input of work, what is the output of the work, and own the solution of that output, to solving a problem you identify.\n\nbuy indiepage, and that will be my am site instead, entrepreneur resume. remove am site, link to indiepage instead and change adampang link\n\nim working on things that others cant, so i position myself low supply higher demand. time and output disconnected. more creative, less rote\n\nits like a semi-counterculture to VC-backed startups where they basically go "all in" on one idea, where this strat is more "many small bets"\n\nin entrepreneurship, the masses are never right. trust principles and results, understand where the value is. quiet success. find an empty path\n\n1,1,for fame, ask yourself: "why SHOULD people know me" so actually be good in startups, then show mrr to show value generated. solving problems.\n\nwin at ns as a solopreneur, then help people with 1 on 1 founder therapy, after i get something to work.. went from 0 to 10k with x project, in y months\n\nget your life profitable. you are a startup lol. in more ways than 1. life is full of marketplaces in different spaces. its actually all 1 space. its all the same thing\n\nsaying "im gonna be an entrepreneur" is like saying "im gonna grow up to be an employee" ok.. but for what? thats a method of working, its not saying WHAT youre working on\n\nhow do i productize myself, i can be low supply with combinatorics and combinations with venns, but its gotta be aligned with the great problems of our time. important and urgent\n\njust like a product in the free market. productize yourself, be a low supply high demand person. solve problems and help solve problems, maslow pointed to this with transcendence.\n\n6) own a piece of a business and scale = If I'm not wealthy by this point, so I have financial freedom and can work on even more awesome creative projects, without having to worry.\n\nminimum viable entrepreneurship to solve debt. minimum viable visible competence = fame = solve lovelessness. charisma, etc. import dan b and oriron t advice whatever. kiedis whatever\n\nsell before building? put a waitlist on a landing page? see if they want it, then the ideas that i love and they love, thats the product i build first. a paid waitlist. if not, i refund?\n\nmaybe i should build in public, to attract indiehackers on X and IG. so i can solve the loneliness problem while solving my debt and sexlessness problem on Feb 9, 2025 at 1:30 PM - 2:00 PM\n\ni only need to make 2k to get back to where i was. this indiehacking path is proven i can show mama. maybe i do need to be on twitter not sure, maybe i dont because there are indiehackers that dont\n\nwe can literally all win, yeah a bar will cause attrition, but in principle all CAN have an outcome of a profitable project that pays the bills or even hits tons of criteria for success, money first of all.\n\ntalk about how its okay to start with zip2 first. elon and adcock both do it. there are good permissionless leverage reasons why starting with software before energy gas manufacturing can be a good decision.\n\nthe reason you start with the problem is because you know theres demand there. the reason you learn about the frontier technologies is because that is low supply of competitors. sell water to a thirsty desert man\n\nrace to 26 bucks a day. how about 1 dollar online? i control my input, not exactly my ouptuts* gotta start crankin out permissionless leverage. nail it before scaling it. get 10 users to love it. even 1. find 1 person.\n\ni mean i wanna do like what elon did and get wealthy with code (permissionless leverage like naval says, along with media to build relationships at scale, like david senra pointed out), then i can work in the atom-tech thats foundational like energy gas manufacturing housing\n\nartists should be self sufficient: profitable songwriter producer marketer etc. fullstack indie shit. and if you do have a team have it be a small highly aligned navy seal type team where its a hell yeah for every new crew member like luffy. if there is doubt there is no doubt\n\nmy indiehacking businesses are market experiments like music, and you can adjust poker-like resource allocation based on conviction and data. like the balaji civ tech tree analogy with trunks and roots and leaves. leaves become roots become trunks. have strong mental explanatory scaffolding and xyz\n\nsometimes its best to retire a project if your founder instincts and passionn for it are gone. and maybe competition landscape has changed. like the react channel, or maybe work on total delegation so it operates without you and you can squeeze the last out of it before retiring it when its a mess???\n\nstartups fail because they lack knowlesge and are experimenting to find out knowlesge on the fly. but you can also have the knowledge and have a principled successful startip on the first go. and do it over and over. i take luck out of the vocab. learned that from theil. explanations reach infinity and we can build out our explanations along vectors. explanations are potentioal and actions manifest em\n\nunlike internship and renting out time, if i can get from 0to1 on a project, it can scale to the size of the internet, which grows as a continent, and i have tons of ideas now thanks to the sg increased explanatory mental scaffolding, i even have more ideas. this is indiehacking. pieter levels og pioneer love him. and hes a counterexample, he doesnt sell shovels like marc lou as his highest earning product. now its photoai.\n\nclean room and bulk sell clothes to someone. make a bid connect to local fashion curators. starting bid, heres the closing date. give to noah and shit idk. put my sizes, here are pics of em all, 30 pieces, whats the bulk price you paying? maybe just put on fb marketplace. the buggest engineer mistake is building what doesnt need to be built. dont just build to build, be intentional and principled with the economic system for sustainability and goals\n\nimagine if i could wave a wand and all my internet startup ideas were done being coded and ready to meet the market. then what? id have to find where the relevant people are, then show them the change they seek to make, i provide, for a cost (my pricing algo). nail it before you scale it. put an ideasbugs button on the bottom right of every startup so i get feedback. make it easy for them to tell me whats wrong or what could be better, am i hitting the target yaknow?\n\ngive away free resources like relevant blog posts, or make hower free but the text processing ai usage billed base. build trust with working free things, and if i nail the solving of a problem, that will generate word of mouth. make it easy for me to use, and therefore it will be easy for users to use. make it clear who its for in the headline: are you an overwhelmed achiever? are you an overwhelmed writer? etc. maybe give away the list to calendar extension. just like marc lou gives away the logofast etc. or yongfook idk. do what works. idk about pieter levels. check him hes the best at indiehacking. right?\n\n
