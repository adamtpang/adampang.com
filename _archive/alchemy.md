gathering reagents for the potion of life i desire.\n\nns is a moral duty to protect the candle of the west\n\nskillstacks are reagents for life potions goal states\n\ncreations are offerings to infinity, offerings to God.\n\npsychadelics are like its the same yarn, just untangled\n\nscience and religion both have the mystery as ultimate.\n\ndreams are to reality as reality is to psychedelic-state\n\nwe are but conduits, manifestations of and for the spirit.\n\nwealth is transformation, so think in terms of magic wands\n\nlove is seeing the interconnectedness of all, seeing source\n\nevery creation is an offering to God. out of love and devotion\n\ncan you integrate matter with what matters? i dont see why not\n\nyou can map tenets of ancient religions to newer better theories\n\nthe timeless compounds. curate away the temporary, after proper creation\n\nyou can subtract with a vessel of structure, and you keep giving giving.\n\nmoney is a store of value, which is abstracted "solving problems" "points"\n\nprompting is like making potions, you throw in shit and see what comes out\n\neven biblical names are signals with value prompts. implicit directives/suggestions\n\nits so weird to turn nascent abstractions and manifesting them into cold hard reality\n\n"technology temple" haha. i love the intersection of scientific and religious themes.\n\nlike how the ancients knew black box outputs, but didnt have the explanatory knowledge\n\na free market is the wisdom of genes and memes. truth seeking error correcting mechanisms.\n\nbalaji is like: if we all combine these reagents, by principle well get this potion/reaction\n\nsecrets are truths only few know. secrets are whispered by reality, you see them in glimpses.\n\nhow do you hide harsh transformative truths? through fiction, through fools, through complexity\n\nbe a love conqueror. find the intersections of paganism and christianity. combine zeus and jesus.\n\nthere is a thin throughline that navigates infinity. it is through the eye of a needle to get to heaven\n\nif physics and math are fundamentals of stem, music is fundamental to meaning/feeling, at that base level\n\npowerful and good, this reconciles the ideological vectors of past paganism and recent christian paradigms\n\nwrite about infinite being, and reconciling pagan and christian paradigms, and reconciling science and religion\n\nreconcile how i acknowledge infinite bing but still confused about infinite consciousness. "in God's presence" wow\n\nwhen you cant find the answer in the world of matter, you find it in the word of symbols and patterns, and must return.\n\nwhenever there is a seemingly conflict of theories, there is a hidden unifying theory that is more true than the previous 2+\n\nwealth is a set of transformations you are capable of bringing about, its like how strong is your magic wand??? great frame maybe\n\nwealth is not just transformation but relevant transformation. if you can turn wood to coal good, wood to uranium depends on civ lvl\n\nis the earth a universal constructor? superorganism that self corrects, has subcomponents that perform transformations from raw constituants\n\nns nodes can have diff stats, diff levels of intensity along certain vectors, you can hop around eventually, given the party dues and all that. magic wand + good ideas = wealth = transformations (deutsch)\n\nusing vector sum as an analogy, you can get to the same goal state through diff angles, approaches. like a potion, like chemistry, as long as the reagents, the ingredients come together in the right way, the sufficient variables will get the outcome you desire\n\nshould you work on the bottleneck or the influential first? nodes feed into each other. energy is foundational, but housing costs the most per month. so houses should be worked on? so cover, thats manufacturing, that takes energy education. each industry is like a potion with reagents\n\n
