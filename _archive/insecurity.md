should you share these? back to the TMI online topic.

for a long time ive been insecure about my height. im 5'5.5

back to stoicism, its not really something i chose, so why worry about it?

also. i feel like people will leave me. either i need to change, i cant be myself. idk i wont NOT be myself, AND i know when i need to change to improve

i feel like i have to impress them for them to like me. but again, make decisions so I LIKE I, do not look around to others, only up to God
