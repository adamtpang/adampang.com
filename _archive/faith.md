i mean the slope is different from the y intercept

subtract the subtractor

power law

subtract the subtractor\n\nsolving lifees equations\n\njudge based on y int AND slope\n\nis there infinity here or not?\n\nyou are a point in vector space\n\norder of operations really matters\n\nthink in magnitudes, count in exponents\n\nmy slope needs to help me survive here for the y int shit..\n\nonline is counatbly infinite. offline is uncountably infinite.\n\nNOT all will like me. NOT none will like me. the shape of the power law does not change\n\nyour explanatory gets you from starting point to goal state. the desire the meaning the relevance is all along that path. experiments reveal the shape of the path from here to there\n\n
