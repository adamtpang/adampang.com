God, state, network, all combined now?\n\nsome clues to spot a parasitic idea is when they are static (im too old for this), unquestionable (from an authority), moralizing (money is the root of all evil), or religious dogma (unquestionable, lest punishment)\n\ni do need more play to destress, more nature, massage. but at the same time this is spoiled? nah fuck that its cheap, and just solve problems. listen to elon more than donovan along the money vector. its quantifiable\n\nif garry tan says theres too much money in the world + thiel's communism no idea conspiracy. how do we create new knowledge, ethics points us in the right direction, procedural deutschian knowledge is how to get there\n\nkpop is bottlenecked by the economics of the business. how do they make money? sponsorships, ads, whats the burn? housing, hiring people for songs, videos, content. what problem does it solve? taking a tech look at kpop\n\nlook through all ideas i got and see which is the best size? go for size of the problem: quantity and quality of the utility. how many people will this solve a problem for, to what degree is the problem severe? painful?\n\nmake 2x2 matrices for life concepts. share mental explanatory scaffolding: you can stick out and fit in in good and bad ways. eisenhower matrix. definite optimism. my fav 2x2s lol. visible competence. wealthy healthy wise\n\nnet worth usually is a measure of the quantity quality of problems youve solved. value generated and value captured. value is just problems solved (true economy is output of useful goods and services (that solve problems))\n\nis the real metric views of subs? how do you measure follower QUALITY? because the quantity is apparent. i think you gotta index w pagerank. like a small account with great followers is worth more than a 10x quantity account\n\nimperfections guide improvement. if you know whats wrong, you know exactly what to improve on. seek good explanations that account for all observations, and use that explanation to intervene for the better, to correct errors\n\nfor example the youtube kids channels with 8 mags of followers has breadth but not depth, founders podcast has depth and mid breadth. its breadth times depth, and i want more depth. peer relationships. and all. timeless vs timely\n\nmy analogy: there are buildings and just like a plato cave, there are "plato levels" and everyones at a different floor while having multiple buildings within them. openness is a great trait for the super changing world we live in\n\ndamn. so since tboi and error correction has to do with economics too, and since economics also is about relationship economy, then its all connected, all 3 of my top priorities in life are connected. wow. thats super interesting..\n\nsee analytics for everystartup so i know if the price is too high for them, thats why they leave the pricing page. maybe on hower make the price its own page? so i can tell if they leave cause the landing page or the objective price\n\nmoneyball is buying the best quality of player, for the right position, weighted against the cost. quantifying quality for price. even for manager. guilty pleasure post-wealth projects: kpop company, soccer club, philosophy academy.\n\nthe pareto spike is the tallest, the timeless is greatly deep, but only 1 pass on it only gets you so far, that is why you must repeat and reconsume the timeless, because you need to find the nuance in it, you must reach the depths.\n\ni have a ton of false dichotomies that im getting unconflicted about, im explaining my life, and basically weaving theories together, which consolidate the mind, lessen anxiety and depression, the more you understand the congruent, in\n\nmemory is for backprop and extracting morals of the stories: explanatory mental scaffolding of the worls and what theyd do next time. thats what matters the here and now the soon to be. the past is for learning from but not dwelling in\n\nwrite about how schelling points are cool. introduce the game theory concept. we spawn where we spawn in this big game of life, but we choose other things in life. like a stoic, work with what you can control. gain mastery over YOUR life\n\nlist in a list: idea in progress launched money made as status for each project, beautify anchor, find an anchor domain, also put the top ideas i want to build, things down the funnel. remove the 100 apps thing. thats just a hidden challenge\n\nmake an energizer or drainer X analysis app. get a score based on your posts. and show examples of the best and worst posts so its transparent to the user. with these apps, usage based billing. 1 dollar credit to every user. like a crypto wallet\n\nwrite about being sourced, closer to source. the more sourced i get the more i realize peoples opinions are super lossy. linkify this word. scan every document and i can click on the most obscure words to be defined. (just put into a parentheses\n\nwrite about what i learned from diff games. analog and digital. like poker i learned you need to put something on the line to gain something. like kurapika nen contracts. like law of equivalent exchange is the platonic ideal atom configuration thing.\n\npeople have powers like that: diff iqs and big 5 profiles, certain character quirks. make this for the people stats website? show your iq and big 5 traits with crypto proof, is that unethical lol. show your genetic repo? genetic testing and bloodwork\n\nsomeone who has great explanatorr scaffolding but narrow is spoked, but if they find 2 or so spokes and see the inner and outer wheel, they are on the path to being "sourced". they begin to want to find all spokes, and maybe its 3d and spoke in xyz etc.\n\nthere is a power law of the world too. what 1-2 things actually matter at any given time. maybe for me, ns and money matter rn. not love yet. i think ive solved a mature mindset now from tboi and making it my own. i could be wrong but i think ive learned\n\nthere is a power law of the world too. what 1-2 things actually matter at any given time. maybe for me, ns and money matter rn. not love yet. i think ive solved a mature mindset now from tboi and making it my own. i could be wrong but i think ive learned\n\ni like the ideas of bjorn lomberg, but it seems to me that you cant change the shape of the power law, BUT you can raise the ceiling, or the floor, but the shape wont change. the question is which direction per unit effort raises the most? most positive EV\n\nwhere are the biggest global markets and their airtasker competitors? and see where the company ALREADY is: like for me itll be guam, but through market analysis, the best 8020 markets are xyz countries, and heres our strat like uber to build 2 sided marketplace\n\nlearn and understand the systems that interest you, then knobs, buttons, and levers appear, and suddenly you connect dots and you know which variables to manipulate for desired outcomes, this is deutschian procedural knowledge, upon pillars of foundational knowledge\n\nblog with scapple too. like a slideshow, show pics tastefully. also i dont need pics for all of my blogs. use tastefully. the less the better. dont break up the topic until its too long and it makes sense. when its clear theres a division or the posts deserve a second\n\nwrite about my newfound understanding from tboi. errors are in the past, problems are present or future. correct errors by upgrading your explanation and experiments. correct them if you can. what do you do if uncorrectable directly? on Jun 12, 2025 at 8:30 AM - 9:00 AM\n\nOHHHH. stasis is suicidal, because not creating knowledge, with an entropic disaster, can just wipe you out. by allowing yourself to make mistakes, and learning from them, you actually prevent the biggest mistake of suicide by stasis.. this is the easter island problem..\n\ni dont need to be confident in myself, only confident in the machinery of knowledge creation, its more like detective work. oh shit. so investment is more like an experiment of a thesis that costs. asking questions and learning is free.. thats how you gain power if you will\n\nim not convinced of the 3 fitness style presence ai ideas because unlike cal ai, you can figure out those things without an ai app, but with cal ai, you actually cant really, just by looking at a sandwich, figure out the macros and calories on Feb 7, 2025 at 1:30 PM - 2:00 PM\n\nwrite about how you dig and dig, you find a new insight. and you can quickly regurgitate the insight, but forget the path of digging.  + compress ideas and actions for those low bandwidth moments. + bad days = low dopamine low bandwidth low flow. + flow is found in problem solving\n\nthe market cap is an indication of the market landscape. a so called exponential growth curve is actually an s curve that inflates to fill the market demand of the market landscape. like gradient descent. there is always market opportunity. solve problems, learn skills, own leverage\n\nsharing specific knowledge (rare explanations) signals you have a positive sum axiomatic mental explanatory scaffolding = infinite game player. easier said when youre wealthy. when not, maybe go thiel route and keep secrets to a minimum sharing, so you can build wealth THEN share idk\n\nstart with just 1 pole: for and against, and use literal moral exemplars to align values, then have a threshold like 80% aligned. how can you compute? maybe you want 10 examples for and against, shuffled, so that you dont overindex in bias. so elon + 9, greta thunberg + 9 anti examples.\n\nthe weird thing is having a skill, then applying based on a skill. but a skill is a means to an end, so it begs the question, what is that end? to me thats the problem, solution, team, skill framework. knowledge, skills, connections, and location are fundamental variables to "career science"\n\nyour artistic signature is revealed in the patterns of your body of work. its like jungian rambling. create new knowledge if existing knowledge isnt doing it. how do you find the right things salient, to pay attention to, if attention is a point in vector space, in this infinite game of life\n\nwrite a blog post showing how you can unbundle the left and right parties of the usa. opt in and out on 1 vector each. show that youre mixed with spatial voting. vectors. you can be mixed. if you fall into a bucket, youre not thinking for yourself. show results PER vector and moral innovation\n\nidk if it was jung but i think he would have his patients just ramble, then patterns would emerge, same thing im trying with the blog. im just gonna ramble, then ill consolidate, then ill clean up thoughts, itll get better and better but at least im starting. letting the perfectionist in LATER\n\ni half agree with thiel, we dont WANT to fail, but every failure is a gift, in that its an opportunity to reconcile lack of knowledge and conflicting theories, it signals we are working at the limits of our knowledge, which means we are at our frontier or even THE frontier of the superorganism\n\nwrite about the new age, its the antiapocalypse, its not utopia, but its the closest we can get to it. capitalism can be out of form or in form: see singapore for inform, see beitain or something for out of form. its a lack of founders understanding investment and regulation that makes business unhospitable\n\nclip the new insights from ancient words. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZxCxN2ZMo&t=6320s dont judge yourself or others, for values that we have now, but didnt know at the time. judge someone by how they play their cards, with what they have, and not by a monday quarterback who has 2020 vision in hindsight..\n\nget a dopamine monitor? or a daily survey easy rating how day went and optional why or comment. then a dashboard over time. measurement hypothesis and feedback. basically what comes to mind today about whats wrong and whats right in life. this creates an axis. like i need wealth and i like the sg trip. dont go and go poles\n\ninsecurity as an attention/money imbalance → separate thread about “emotional dependency as economic dependency” public vs private experimentation → could link to “why i post” or “how to learn faster” NS as a sandbox of different motives → great standalone: “why i signed up for 12 months, and what i’ve seen others come here for”\n\nwhen a master tells about something along the oath it wont make suoer sense till you actually encounter what they pointed to when you encounter it in the oath, and trust is built because what they said came true. what is that epistemological math formual? the one that takes into account stats and chances of something with new info?\n\nif money isnt put to work, its entertainment, not investment. same with skill, if youre not going to be best at X, you can get 80th percentile at xyz, BUT you have to stitch all three together to start to see the combinatorics, AND, it has to be pointing to solving the best problems, like linear algebra where 3 vectors sum to a final arrow\n\nfor hower, show a power law curve and demonstrate how sorting and only doing top tier gets you tremendous output for less input. just by focusing on the right things in the right order: generate curate elevate. they all look like plain tasks, but you must know that hidden: theres 1-2 tasks that matter more than half of all your tasks/ideas\n\nmake a blueprint food scanner directory, put in the processed food product and see how it performs on kpis, like a decentralized public fda, scanning foods for how bad they are based on ingredients and their stats. actually that part of the fda is cool, how they give nutritional facts on back. management starts from measurement like tf said\n\nfirst measure which schools have best outcomes. lets get these kpis in order. what do we look for in graduates. what should they have: health wealth wisdom. just like anyone else. how? sleep diet exercise, theory of wealth creation and permissionless leverage skills, wisdom from timeless books, what else? thats a pretty good general schooling.\n\nthe flat metric problem. if i release content and some unfollow me, i also dont know how much some people liked me more. if i post, some will like it some will not like it. if they dont like it, they unfollow, if they DO like it, theyll like the post. no matter what you do, you signal, no matter what you do, you polarize. because you are a pole.\n\nremember the power law, some people wont be in depth, some will, its not mine or their fault, its just a feature of the universe. some have tons or little bandwidth for you, its just the truth of the situation. dont take it personally, and be fair, you also dont have bandwidth for certain people, so you gotta look at the other side of the coin too. **\n\nyeah maybe its a mistake to continue on these projects. its a mistake to do what shouldnt be done. its a mistake to NOT do what should be done. error correct. figure out how i know if something is a mistake or not. rn im kinda just using taste and salience and current understanding i guess. i guess thats all you have.. idk on Jun 13, 2025 at 7:30 AM - 8:00 AM\n\nmake topic blog raw notes, then crystallized forms later on subtopics, well maybe just subtopic categorizations, then when its small enough, i can make a cohesive point, itll be its own blog post. make sure readers know if this is a raw blog post or a crystallized blog post (like resources transformations) it should be able to stand on its own and a clear thesis\n\nmetrics are flat. just like a price is a threshold, you dont know the max of what the user would be willing to pay, you only know they derived x dollar amount of value / problem-solving. how do you know which of your followers REALLY likes you. how can you quantify that? solve the flat metrics problem. maybe REAL likes should cost 1 dollar, and it goes to the creator.\n\nevolution doesnt "design" per se. were not designed for 1 thing. sometimes parts of our brain can be exapted for a different purpose. like hypothalemus was for balance for example, idk if i got the right term but bear with me. now its used for MENTALLY balancing. same mini organ, different but similar utlity. but why even say it? say what repeats. articulate what repeats. understand it so you can solve your problems.\n\nshould you go for the most foundational link in the chain or the most expensive link? energy-manufacturing vs housing. well housing is manufacturing or can be. additive. check the economics of cover and icon, what are the bottlenecks to get housing to be meet the next most expensive link in the chain? apply to iconhomes and cover. check what theyre looking for. know what solutions to join BEFORE you put money to what youre going to learn\n\nwhy is it so hard for people to find jobs that match their potential competence? like if someone knows how to code, why cant they find a coding job? why doesnt the market adjust its salary? supply and demand? software problems are becoming rarer? maybe thats the case. it all stems from problems, and therefore value for people. the world of atoms has a ton to be built into, the utility delta is enormous, maybe software is mostly solved???\n\ni feel like ive been posting about jorunalling, then antirational memes, which are genuinely interesting to me, but i always want to tie it back to ns to be "on topic" i dont HAVE to post, i dont HAVE to be "on topic" i want to be. but then whats stopping me from posting, i dont have a novel, quality-satisfying post, to me yet, its like art. okay then whats my best guess? tabs.. but idk if thats gonna take too long. so then let me find a way to process tabs faster..\n\nwhen people have great track records, it's a mistake to take everything they say as gospel. be sure to maintain your critical thinking faculties, and put those ideas to the test.. don't moralize people, moralize ideas. whenever you attach a static label to yourself or others, it's wrong because even if a long lasting script has been working, "if it aint broke dont fix it" sure, but you should always have the capacity to fix it (dynamism), in the event that entropy does\n\nthought experiment: all cash vaporized, then 100 dollars to every human, how will it reallocate based on goods and services? also show inflation and ownership of social credit through space and time. i owe people since im debt, of my future goods and services, same if I have money on hand, society will then owe me. good vid on this is ray dalio's economic machine, naval advice, elon musk's database metaphor (bad word, but owing goods and services through time and space, the "real economy")\n\nhow do you measure or upgrade your mental explanatory scaffolding? you can measure by success along a vector. the mental scaffolding can explain different vectors and how they work under the hood. then its a persons resources will strategy and character that allow them to ascend a vector. how do you upgrade mental scaffolding? well first what vector/goal do you want to upgrade? what should you downgrade? well the brain autoforgets so thats good. it forgets the temporary and remembers the timeless\n\npower law. time, energy, networks. do 100 thing. drop what is not 8020. if it does not break the laws of physics, it is possible. 1 8020 act. amor fati. which 1 gives me the most energy? energy emotions buttons. baby steps, ferociously. just accept youre different, like balaji. most people club and drink, I like tab-surfing and learning. grow and endure. my goal is to be venn diagram operator-software-hardware-communicator. looking for refreshment. live by principle. by dwelling, you miss the opportunity.\n\nerrors show the way. error awareness leads to improvement. songs apps essays = explanations experiments experiences. projects? instead of apps? follow the salience follow the errors. scooby snacks. no free lunch, no solution that doesnt cost, no experiment that is guaranteed success. just because you fail once doesnt mean you are a failure. thats a fallible theory. just because you succeed once doesnt make you a success. its a stupid question? just like the meaning one on Jun 12, 2025 at 7:30 AM - 8:00 AM\n\nin hower def show the count and percentage from starting amount (last import) ask if they wanna add on top from clipboard or a whole new addition to working db. is there a limit to how many tasks at a time? well how much can i sync and store to their mongodb? how much cost lol as long as CAC > CLV, we good. what percentage of software engineers get to first dollar for projects? mybe 10%? 1%? and of those, how many have good profitable projects? 10% of that 10% idk. but thats stats, doesnt work on individual level baby...!!\n\ncompress truths and directives because we cant hold all tools in our working memory toolbox. sometimes ill forget past insights. but the more i cement it and repeat in life, ill bake it into my subconscious and itll move back into the brain, and ill get quick signal from emotions guiding me. and salience. this is just like code: you write quickly in python, but if you want something to be faster write in rust, then C, etc. be as abstract as you can, but if you cant dig deeper and elon algo the system and process to better it\n\ni admire people who play their hands well. no matter what space time class gender ethnicity whatever. is there a leaderboard for people whove lived great lives? i wanna optimize for that. make a website about this? what makes a great life anyway? this is a question as old as time. maybe its a poorly framed question. i like to ask: what would this look like if it were small? so instead of a life, how about a decade, how about a year, how about a month or a week or day or hour or 10 minutes. maybe time is the wrong frame too idk\n\nAnd like jungian pattern recognition rambling used to do, you can just do a bunch of stuff, aiming for quantity, volume, and then you can purposely do that, and then look back and then edit, curate, critique. Yes, the imperfections guide where you can improve it. And do you do it in public or private? Well it depends on the problem at hand, just do your best at every given moment, just like explanations and the more sure less sure axioms / conjectures that make them up mechanistically, it can forever be evolving to whatever life needs at a time.\n\nwoah. what if all my top salient problems/games are highly related. money is a representaition of what i owe society, ns is how i get more useful, which will make me more money. women like men who are useful and high standing in society, represnting their utility to the tribe, and then feeling like a man is feeling useful, and conttributive. so its all connected? i mean yeah. annd this is the theory of adam's life. the question is how do i get better? thats a poor question, get better at what? making money! well how do you make money? and were back to square one\n\nhow do you help people at scale both and quality and quantity of the help and what does help even mean it depends on what problems people are having and what errors they’re making and what knowledge they’re missing so I guess I can help with explanations experiments and experiences isn’t that what I’m trying to do by doing 100 thing and if I do 100 or something, it gives me a lot of experimental data to work with in terms of improving, my explanation, explanations, and worldview, which informed the quality of the next experiments on Jun 14, 2025 at 6:30 AM - 7:00 AM\n\navoiding mistakes is also avoiding successes. thats why its a "risk" it can be wrong, it can be right. its an experiment. its like were all scientists or detectives, trying to see if something is the case or not. whenever you make a mistake, its because you misunderstood reality, but now that your understanding has been poked, its been shown to be false, that is an opportunity to upgrade your understanding, find a new explanation that accounts for all the phenomena youve encountered thus far, and to make new experiments from that new understanding. explanations and experiments, understanding and action\n\nwatch og startrek, the paypal mafia did, that was a small coallition that did massively productive things. in any creative field the power law makes itself known. dont fight a feature of the universe, its a fools errand to try. write a super short blog post 2 paragraphs about the power law, and linkify it with my app, and shout out the app too for every blog post that uses it (dump text, click on words, or have the ai scan and provide obscure word suggestions, find definition links, or just have definition popups when people click on a word for context. words are conceptual abstractions sometimes with lots of meaning compressed and packed into them. like eschew obfuscation = dont use confusing words so most people can understand what youre trying to say. have ai do grunt work, and you use your human judgement to make executive decisions on where to point the ai's results/outputs\n\nmaybe the reason that superhero movies are so popular is because they symbolically communicate that you can be both good and strong/component. false dichotomies are funny to me, i think they are wrong. i think you can thread the needle in life, but it takes creative unblocking to get to that "third way". there are often moments in life when we are confronted with hard choices, but you actually dont have to choose, we forget this, or dont realize that this is possible. our minds run "creativity programs" that serve up emergent conflict-resolving solutions to our most important problems. lately ive been very interested in the mechanisms of this so called "unblocking" what kinds of parasitic ideas / antirational memes exist in our minds, there are unquestionable authorities within ourselves and outside of ourselves, even if we dont realize it. but everything and every idea and person can be questioned. just because elon has a great track record and says something doesnt mean its true. he has a great track record of getting things to be stably right, yes.. but everyone is fallible. it is like im just regurgiating the beginning of infinity knowledge, but i mean, its genuinely interesting, i do want to live from that "spirit" of play, curiosity, strength, upskilling, "leveling up" if you will. that seems a moral good!\n\nChallenges and Implications:\n\nFeasibility and Technical Considerations:\n\nFeasibility and Technical

If X has no public searchable index for PageRank-like analysis, your project could potentially contribute new insights, but it would also require careful planning to manage data volume, storage, and processing.\n\nfor hower, show a power law curve and demonstrate how sorting and only doing top tier gets you tremendous output for less input. just by focusing on the right things in the right order: generate curate elevate. they all look like plain tasks, but you must know that hidden: theres 1-2 tasks that matter more than half of all your tasks/ideas\n\nthese pithy truths hook. compressed truth scaffolds, so when it encounters you in life you know the way, or your mental explanatory scaffolding is wrong and go from frontier to deep truths. carte had to throw away everything. but flow and heuristical matter too. unconscious preprocessing idk vervake knows more. what does he think about desires?\n\nlets say you want 10, life gives you a 4 as a starting hand, but the equation you want is 10 = x + y + 15. you dont control y, but you do control x, so make x what you need it to be. and you got it lol. maybe you want it to be 0 instead of 10. cause in the og example x + y = -5. so make x = 5 for it to cancel out. life is like math in a lot of ways\n\nmake topic blog raw notes, then crystallized forms later on subtopics, well maybe just subtopic categorizations, then when its small enough, i can make a cohesive point, itll be its own blog post. make sure readers know if this is a raw blog post or a crystallized blog post (like resources transformations) it should be able to stand on its own and a clear thesis\n\ni love convition through reason. a steel frame, a balaji clothesline(great for memory), he loads into his gpu. also math is great for visualization. i have synesthesia thats a gift too. we have powers like avatar. peoples genes give them mmorpg race benefits and drawbacks. exptic, maybe melanin maybe you have beauty standards here or there, or maybe blacks are better for sport. the results speak for themselves\n\ni used mathematical analogies like balaji's vector visualization and just vectorized my whole life. it was an insight cascade and it recontextualized so much of life. thats why we remember the past, we hold the unprocessed till an explanatory framework/scaffolding can make sense of it, then our brain compresses the truth/meaning/explanation, and we can forget it more. maybe insight cascades are great because it compresses the past, then\n\neveryone has diff values, and not just direction but magnitude. i totally get taylor swift's endoresement of harriss based on what she posted. you gotta keep an open mind, but uh im coming at it from an economic policy pov, shes coming at it from a personality and history POV. so OF COURSE we have different choices. everyones diff everyone makes diff choices and therefore diff outcomes emerge. the power law is a universal feature not man-made, it occurs in nature, or any creative field\n\nhow do you measure or upgrade your mental explanatory scaffolding? you can measure by success along a vector. the mental scaffolding can explain different vectors and how they work under the hood. then its a persons resources will strategy and character that allow them to ascend a vector. how do you upgrade mental scaffolding? well first what vector/goal do you want to upgrade? what should you downgrade? well the brain autoforgets so thats good. it forgets the temporary and remembers the timeless\n\nIf you're interested in existing datasets or partial indexes, some academic papers or open data projects might have shared their methodologies or even datasets, though these would be for research purposes and not continuously updated or comprehensive. what are the implications of doing a verified accounts X pagerank crawl? 1 post 25 web pages Conducting a PageRank crawl on X specifically targeting verified accounts has several implications across technical, social, ethical, and business dimensions:\n\nhighschool in a way doesnt end, there are grade levels and heirarchy remains, but age and grade level disconnect after graduation. you can have a 16 year old in grade level 32 for example (supposed to be age 32) substance and time are independent variables. reality compiles in time. is the 4th dimension really time? how about 4+ dimensions? how do they work? if a 4th dimensional object passed through 3d space, wed see a basketball come into reality, then dissapear, changing in size like a sine wave\n\ni love this quality of life measurement, awareness, vetting of ideas, deliberate improvement of life. life is surrounded by problems. problems arent the problem lol, its you ability and knowledge about the problems thats the problem. if you have infinite problems but infinite solution ideas and infinite leveraged action and judgement, life is a fun game where you play. meaning can be found in the motion of life. happiness is peace in motion? happiness is a loaded term it can mean meaning or hedonism\n\ni wish i could find what notes i repeat most, by count. make an app out of this for blog workspace, and itll reveal my jungian ramblings, and i know what to post most. what are my hard rules about internet hygeine and what i share online?

well how much can i sync and store to their mongodb? how much cost lol as long as CAC > CLV, we good. what percentage of software engineers get to first dollar for projects? mybe 10%? 1%? and of those, how many have good profitable projects? 10% of that 10% idk. but thats stats, doesnt work on individual level baby...!!\n\ncompress truths and directives because we cant hold all tools in our working memory toolbox. sometimes ill forget past insights. but the more i cement it and repeat in life, ill bake it into my subconscious and itll move back into the brain, and ill get quick signal from emotions guiding me. and salience. this is just like code: you write quickly in python, but if you want something to be faster write in rust, then C, etc. be as abstract as you can, but if you cant dig deeper and elon algo the system and process to better it\n\nData Collection: You would need to collect data on who follows whom among the accounts you follow. This would require API access, which might be limited by X's policies. Processing Power: Aggregating and analyzing this data to find commonalities would require significant computational resources, especially for users with many followings. Visualization: Creating an intuitive UI for social graphs involves complex graph visualization techniques to ensure the graph is readable and interactive. Scalability: The system should handle varying network sizes gracefully, without performance issues. Real-Time Updates: To keep the visualization current, you'd need to update it when users follow or unfollow accounts or when new "gems" emerge.\n\nfor local legends you can note down how games roughly went for you, areas to improve. and based on your own self assessment and what went right and wrong, you can improve and experiment next game, get feedback from players, like after a game everyone can rate their top highlighted player and worst player idk and see trends of your rating over time, can be used for league games too. can show local games on island, public private. group chats, invite only games, and importantly, based on your stats and height and stuff and age, you can get recommendations where you best play, and kpis to look out for and exemplars of the sport in each position with similar age/style/stats/height, and you have case studies. like for me i seem to be best as a short defender so i should study verratti\n\nInfluence Mapping: For marketers or analysts, understanding the network of influence among verified accounts could be valuable for strategic engagements or influencer marketing. Platform Dynamics: Such a crawl could reveal how verification status affects network structure and content spread, possibly informing platform policy changes or new features. Monetization Strategy: X might see this as an opportunity or threat to its monetization strategy, particularly if the analysis shows how verified accounts drive engagement or if it highlights any systemic biases introduced by the verification system. Competitive Analysis: Competitors or researchers could use this data to understand X's ecosystem better, perhaps influencing how other platforms approach verification and influence metrics.\n\nPrivacy Concerns: Even if you're only targeting public data, the aggregation and analysis of this data raise privacy concerns, particularly if the analysis is used to draw conclusions about individuals or groups. Ethical Use of Data: Using data from verified accounts without explicit permission can border on ethical lines, especially if the analysis is used for commercial or surveillance purposes. Impact on Content Visibility: If your findings were to become public, they might influence how X manages its content visibility algorithms, potentially altering the organic reach of verified accounts. Misinformation: A misinterpretation of the data could lead to misinformation, especially if the analysis suggests certain accounts are more influential than they are, based solely on verification status.\n\nIn summary, a verified accounts PageRank crawl on X could offer valuable insights into influence dynamics but also poses challenges in data management, ethical considerations, and potential impacts on both individuals and the platform's ecosystem. If you decide to proceed, it's essential to do so with transparency, respect for privacy, and adherence to legal frameworks. but if everyone links their account out of their own volition with oauth, then it will crawl their personal network, visualize it, and index it on certain metrics, that would be cool no? what are the implications of that? and can it be done? 1 post 25 web pages If users willingly connect their X accounts via OAuth for the purpose of having their personal networks crawled, visualized, and indexed based on specific metrics, there are several implications to consider:\n\nIdeological Vectors: Define several axes or dimensions representing different ideological, political, or cultural issues. For example, you might have axes for economic policy (left-right), social issues (progressive-conservative), technology optimism vs. skepticism, etc. User Positioning: Users would answer a series of questions or input data that positions them on these axes. This could be done through surveys, interaction with content (likes, retweets), or by analyzing their posts and the accounts they follow. Visualization: Create a spatial map where each user is a point in this multi-dimensional space. This map could be visualized in 2D or 3D, with users able to zoom in on different ideological areas. Alignment Index: Based on proximity in this ideological space, you could generate an index of accounts that align closely with a user's position. This alignment could be weighted by interaction (how often users engage with similar content) or explicit user feedback.\n\nComplexity: Ideological positions are complex and dynamic; reducing them to points in space might oversimplify nuanced beliefs. Privacy: Users might be hesitant to share enough personal data to accurately plot them on ideological maps, leading to privacy concerns. Polarization: There's a risk of reinforcing existing biases if the system only matches users with those who are ideologically similar. Manipulation: Users might game the system to appear in certain alignments or to influence others, leading to inauthentic interactions. Misrepresentation: Algorithms might misinterpret user signals, placing them inaccurately on the ideological map. Social Engineering: Such a system could be used to push users towards certain narratives or to manipulate public opinion by altering what content or accounts are shown. Technical Feasibility: Mapping multidimensional data visually and interactively requires advanced data handling and visualization techniques, especially for real-time updates as users' views evolve.\n\nData Volume and Management: Verified accounts, especially those with high engagement or influence, can lead to large datasets. Managing this data requires significant storage and computational resources, especially if you're crawling multiple layers deep. Algorithmic Bias: The PageRank algorithm might not account for the nuances of X's social dynamics, like retweet chains or the impact of paid promotions. Since verified accounts often have higher visibility and interaction, this could skew PageRank scores, potentially overvaluing or undervaluing certain accounts based on their verification status rather than true influence or content quality. Crawl Limitations: X's API or web structure might impose rate limits or other restrictions, making it challenging to gather comprehensive data. The verification status might also change, potentially affecting the consistency of your dataset over time. Data Accuracy: Ensuring the accuracy of data, especially concerning the verification status, is crucial. False positives or negatives in verification could skew your results.\n\nXray.social - Analytics + Actions for X and IG Data Aggregation: Collects data from X and Instagram to analyze follower quality. Quality Metrics Analysis: Basic implementation to show not just quantity but also the quality of followers through a shallow PageRank or similar analysis.
