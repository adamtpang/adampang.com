sometimes you can be rash though and give yourself unecessary ptsd lol


fuck, therapy can only be 10 times an insurance year. UGGGG

music sport sleep and progress are my therapy

if youre depressed, the way out is clear goals immediate feedback and challenge skills balance. they call depression anti-flow for a reason. so the 3 constituants of flow aint a bad place to start

does everybody have a suicide threshold? an amount of pain that is unbearable. on the flip side, does everybody have a sword they can arm themselves with against that? meaning to keep you going religiously?

if youre a nerd getting cought up in society and not prepared, dont kill yourself like aaron swartz

curate and remove doubtful posts to reduce anxiety. be strategic in what i share. i can always share again


this isnt a hardship contest lol. pain still sucks no matter who experiences it. eustress is good, not involuntrary distress

if depression is anti flow, and flow is clear goals immediate feedback and challenge skills balance. what is the goal?

if i feel shitty, what do i want?

podcast as therapy alternative? lol

therapy

been going to therapy, every 1 to 2 weeks. i really like it. i need more people to talk to, so im just gonna blog lol

double positive posts to negative. talk about addiction

volume and voluntary approach destigmatize

commitments weigh heavy on me


talk about addiction
why it happens

talk about time urgency, birthday anxiety? substance not time, super high standards

therapists are secular confession

tech sometimes makes me feel sociopathic, shadow, friends true

its a sad life. socially hanging on. i want more security. i gotta be a good friend

i feel permanently tainted by hiring a prostitute. its so sad. a 22 year old virgin thats 5'5.5 in height, in debt, living with mother, living out an oedipal complex, resentful. put the gun down?
are these problems solvable?
i cant go back in time, what can i do to right the wrong?

whats stressing me out? what am i greatful for?

i feel so fuckin miserable. why? money, no concrete plan after singapore. more debt, no girlfriend, little friends. so what?

my dad being an addict makes me feel like marceline that loves simone, but the crown makes him do stuff. and idk if its just drugs or underlying whatevers

write about porn addiction and how i solved it*

get rid of mirrors? decrease depression\n\nwith every swing of the weight, i chip away at depression-anxiety.\n\nmap your mind as closely coupled to reality. work with REALITY, not falsities\n\n“i dont want to exist right now but i know ill fall in love with life again. sometime soon.”\n\nmaybe we should do an NS terrace house, auto blurs out people that DONT opt in, but its a docuseries just like terrace house. idk thats a fun little thing\n\ndespair and depression is when you cant see the light at the end of your tunnels, but its always there, and the puzzle never ends, but what you can do is position yourself better in life. status among others no, status among your past and future selves. salient problems, understanding, action. happiness is found in motion, meaning, flow.\n\n
