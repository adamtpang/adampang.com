why?

so what?

its so sad.

what is the goal?

i really like it.

put the gun down?

socially hanging on.

i want more security.

whats stressing me out?

what am i greatful for?

i feel so fuckin miserable.

are these problems solvable?

be strategic in what i share.

podcast as therapy alternative?

if i feel shitty, what do i want?

an amount of pain that is unbearable.

meaning to keep you going religiously?

money, no concrete plan after singapore.

salient problems, understanding, action.

more debt, no girlfriend, little friends.

they call depression anti-flow for a reason.

pain still sucks no matter who experiences it.

i cant go back in time, what can i do to right the wrong?

i can always share again


this isnt a hardship contest lol.

status among others no, status among your past and future selves.

i gotta be a good friend

i feel permanently tainted by hiring a prostitute.

on the flip side, does everybody have a sword they can arm themselves with against that?

i need more people to talk to, so im just gonna blog lol

double positive posts to negative.

so the 3 constituants of flow aint a bad place to start

does everybody have a suicide threshold?

my dad being an addict makes me feel like marceline that loves simone, but the crown makes him do stuff.

happiness is found in motion, meaning, flow.\n\n

lol

therapy

been going to therapy, every 1 to 2 weeks.

work with REALITY, not falsities\n\n“i dont want to exist right now but i know ill fall in love with life again.

a 22 year old virgin thats 5'5.5 in height, in debt, living with mother, living out an oedipal complex, resentful.

and idk if its just drugs or underlying whatevers

write about porn addiction and how i solved it*

get rid of mirrors?

sometimes you can be rash though and give yourself unecessary ptsd lol


fuck, therapy can only be 10 times an insurance year.

decrease depression\n\nwith every swing of the weight, i chip away at depression-anxiety.\n\nmap your mind as closely coupled to reality.

sometime soon.”\n\nmaybe we should do an NS terrace house, auto blurs out people that DONT opt in, but its a docuseries just like terrace house.

eustress is good, not involuntrary distress

if depression is anti flow, and flow is clear goals immediate feedback and challenge skills balance.

UGGGG

music sport sleep and progress are my therapy

if youre depressed, the way out is clear goals immediate feedback and challenge skills balance.

if youre a nerd getting cought up in society and not prepared, dont kill yourself like aaron swartz

curate and remove doubtful posts to reduce anxiety.

substance not time, super high standards

therapists are secular confession

tech sometimes makes me feel sociopathic, shadow, friends true

its a sad life.

talk about addiction

volume and voluntary approach destigmatize

commitments weigh heavy on me


talk about addiction
why it happens

talk about time urgency, birthday anxiety?

idk thats a fun little thing\n\ndespair and depression is when you cant see the light at the end of your tunnels, but its always there, and the puzzle never ends, but what you can do is position yourself better in life.
