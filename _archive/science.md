podcast is called "superorganism"

there are no rules except physics -musk and deutsch

zahavian signals, showing what you can do







emergent properties gotta be a wonder of the world. file this under awe insights. talk about the living chain from the first life forms to us. our ancestors got this far, its our turn to hold the candle and not let the candle of life go out



what else could we know, us, the superorganism, an offshoot of life

superorganism w adam pangelinan

talk about psychadelics

deviation selection





energy emotions buttons\n\nemergent properties gotta be a wonder of the world. file this under awe insights. talk about the living chain from the first life forms to us. our ancestors got this far, its our turn to hold the candle and not let the candle of life go out\n\nthere are no rules except physics -musk and deutsch\n\npain is plasticity\n\ntalk about psychadelics\n\nscience is not fixed. its a method\n\nblue blocking contacts\n\nfood is a substance too\n\nyour hair is a calendar\n\nns lightning rod frreal\n\nplacebo can actually work\n\ndo the microplastics test\n\nsensory deprivation at ns\n\n“the dose makes the poison.”\n\n"The dose makes the poison."\n\nentropy is the default state.\n\nexplore much of space and time\n\nbring microplastics test to ns\n\nim truly confident in my new MO\n\nim truly confident in my new MO\n\nscience is not fixed. its a method\n\nplaywork affects sleep affects playwork\n\nentrepreneurship is just-in-time science\n\nsleep is for learning and truth compression\n\nbe in a cold ass room for more energy and iq\n\nif it does not break physics, it is possible.\n\npsychedelics amplify conjecture and criticism\n\ntitrate caffeine. eschew obfuscation. smell heads\n\ngotta get a nucleus kit.. gotta do microplastics test\n\nbaldwin effect. genetics memetics. science and religion.\n\nsuccessful experiment > failed experiment > no experiment.\n\npsychadelics are at the intersection of science and religion\n\nif it does not break physics, science fiction is science faction\n\nyeah we can still die, but dont get in the way of life extension..\n\nemergent properties are one of the most interesting things in life\n\nim fascinated by emergence, and things we dont quite understand yet\n\nwe are trending toward all diff configs of atoms, wow.. what vector?\n\nwe are trending toward all diff configs of atoms, wow.. what vector?\n\nholy shit david deutsch's explanations explains science and religion\n\ni gain confidence in proportion to understanding, action, and results\n\nactually do the microplastics test on Feb 4, 2025 at 7:00 PM - 7:30 PM\n\nbe like a detective, a scientist, ask questions, articulate, connect dots\n\nerrors mean youre at the frontier of your understanding. the superorganism\n\nexperiments can't fail. you always learn from the relationship between input and output.\n\nfor newton, the ideas were obvious to him, unknown to others. communication can help here.\n\nhuberman is a scientific priest. if you cant buy it build it. if you cant join it, found it.\n\nscientists test along the vector of a problem, toward the good. "in that direction" "toward.."\n\nhaving psychadelics on campus would help with problem solving i swear, just microdoses come on..\n\nthese tiny twitter and blog experiments build my confidence for bigger experiments like podcasting\n\npower laws have turned into 1 power law oof. maybe mars and diff planets will create the multiplicity again\n\nremember that the gradient landscape shifts irl, minimas combine, change shape, grow shrink etc. think of the ocean as an analogy\n\ntalk about the dose is the poison. even with ns with friends, with balaji. even with yourself. medicine to poison is in the dose.\n\nexperiments cant fail, they only inform. and then with that new information, you can conjecture a new understanding, work on it, then act on it.\n\nlearn how to excrete / solve microplastics, lets see if ifts even a problem first then do rag scholarly studies research online for the best theory of it.\n\nfrom first principles, can we grow after the bones fuse? maybe we can reeopen the window of hgh and growth, then fuse back again with synthetic intervention?\n\ncan we measure population's bio age not chrono age? which demographics are doing best? i mean its sorta the same in the name of death, first vital organ to fail.\n\nmake alcohol without the negative side effects.. put this in project list. no shortage of project ideas, no shortage of “whats” now i need the “hows” the knowledge, the fuckin understanding..\n\nwrite about whats the point of ns. who it could matter to individually, why it matters in the broad sense, and the micro sense. make it hella clear. maybe do the ns miscellaneous one on this..\n\nwhat if we have cryptographically verifiable recent epigenetic age tests, that serve as age limits instead of chronological age? so the younger your age slope, the more rewards for you? for whatever idk\n\nso many people have done psychadelics here, maybe 50%-75%, because of the high openness effect it has. it makes people 1 standard deviation higher in trait openness, which is cool/crazy, depending.. dont do it if youre schizo though haha.\n\nwrite a twitter thread about dopamine being the real economy, piggybacking off huberman. sleep caffiene is mixed, eustress good. video games mixed, flow good, porn bad. those are what comes to mind. should be a whoop for dopamine lol. how to measure?\n\ni finished both the blueprint and nucleus test kits, and the blueprint envelope already has the address and stamp. im assuming youre just dropping these nucleus kits to the post office, so could you just include this small envelope with your outgoing mail?\n\nwe are infinitely ignorant, AND explanations can reach infinity, like an excel column that is filled to the infinite bottom, like math, physics, etc. knowledge wealth creation, science. and not only are they infinitely explanatory, they become relevant sometimes\n\nwrite about the dopamine economy: the health trio of course, eustress is proactive. coffee gives you dopamine and makes you more receptive, gotta talk about your brain giving you more dopamine when youre on to something. dopamine is about the “lead up” to something positive. so get yourself some good explanations so you know how to get what you want. beginning of infinity. dopamine is the first economy.\n\nhow do you solve microplastics? rhonda patrick brocolli? new knowledge solves all solvable problems. solving microplastics does not break the laws of physics. if it doesnt break the laws of physics, its absolutely possible, so now the bottleneck, the dependency is a lack of understanding and action. its all about problems -> understanding -> action. meaning/happiness/flow is found in the constant motion of this life process\n\nnervous system: sleep, relationships, therapy is loaning\n\nuse your taste and turn on and off faucets based off taste\n\nsoap is great tech: cheap, kills our killers. who invented it?\n\nscience is about being less wrong. but explanations reach infinity\n\n3 time travel and speed of light travel? or faster or traversing multiverse?\n\nwe are living creatures made up of living creatures thats so freakin cool. cells\n\na sperm swimmiing its way to an egg is like getting to market lol. just get to market first, then you can optimize each link in the supply chain\n\nwrite a twitter thread about dopamine being the real economy, piggybacking off huberman. sleep caffiene is mixed, eustress good. video games mixed, flow good, porn bad. those are what comes to mind. should be a whoop for dopamine lol. how to measure?\n\nwrite about the dopamine economy: the health trio of course, eustress is proactive. coffee gives you dopamine and makes you more receptive, gotta talk about your brain giving you more dopamine when youre on to something. dopamine is about the “lead up” to something positive. so get yourself some good explanations so you know how to get what you want. beginning of infinity. dopamine is the first economy.\n\nhow do you solve microplastics?
