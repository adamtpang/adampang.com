darwinian evolution theory is a "good enough" system.

variation and selection shape the superorganism (species and all of life)

this is like what vervaeke and peterson talk about with agent-arena fittedness. its so cool because life does this: mosquitos birth tons of babies (variation), and tons die (selection) (a stress test)

this is like what happens in our brain "our thoughts die so we dont have to"

not only are humans like those mosquitos, but we also have that going on in our heads.

its like peace and war times, when tons of thoughts have to die, plasticity rises, new patterns are picked up. explore and exploit modes oscillate

its pretty crazy how species branch off from one another with time and deviation. like edo period. we cant mate with chimps. humanity is on its own when it comes to species. homo sapiens

creation and curation. variation and selection. genes and memes\n\nvariation, selection. memes on genes. we run evolution's OS on evolution. + empathy is OS emulation within an OS\n\nmentally, humans can become new species. we have a genetic evolution layer, and a memetic evolution layer. the software can change while the hardware stays the same\n\n
