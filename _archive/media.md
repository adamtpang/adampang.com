i wanna start a podcast. speed and volume. called "superorganism"

a podcast is like someone hearing in on our conversation

what are the forms of media?: blog, youtube, spotify, tXitter, instagram

you could say art is media too: music, film, etc

...

going for 1000 true fans

IG is also building relationships at scale. orchestrate each: IG, blogs, podcast, youtube, spotify, tXitter

i learned: make IG stories landscape instead. turn em landscape in photos first, THEN post. do 100 thing. you dont know whats good yet??? i learned by doing, i wouldnt of knowndoes everyone who is famous get death threats and stuff? gpt it

linkedin update:
under construction

at least ill be honest on linkedin

twitter is like a newsletter. i want some to be highlighted and broadcast, other things to be optional to read

make it TXitter

talk about the best of the twitter experiment, twitter curate. curation is thoughtful and useful

twitter game

so many people show themselves online and they dont die

if "nEt WoRtH is NeT WoRtH" then podcast blog youtube spotify tXitter is a way. just be yourself

do a talk with people i wanna talk to. parse ig twitter linkedin


analogize to a dunbar village tmi online

young people on twitter i think are going somewhere: luke farritor, aydin gokce

why not twitter? i dont want to force feed info to people

reach out to twitter ig linkedin txitter

"tXitter"

so post on spotify, youtube, twitter, through anchor/spotify podcasters?

talk about the 100 tweets experiment

mrbeast is media leverage. but i dont wanna be famous though.

how much should you share online? talk about the tribal 150 dunbar number example

i dont want to tweet as much as i do blog, because tweeting is like shoving words down someones throat, its forced into their feed, let it be optional. minimal advertisement that points to your longer body of work

mrbeast is media leverage. but i dont wanna be famous though.

music is media which is leverage. basically the internet is leverage, internet first. balaji

so post on spotify, youtube, twitter, through anchor/spotify podcasters?

what topics, who comes to mind, and who are the side characters that i could pull?\n\nmy posts will get more nuanced over time, itll get cleaned up, noise will turn to signal. i should trim the titles too. i should put emojis in title.\n\n“rubberband name” or “blueblockers” health conscious conservatives. make an ns digital newspaper? w a comedy part? “reports from the edge of the world”\n\nfor a lot of podcasts, the network effect, the power law is fueled by the viewership, and then it goes to people that want that attention, and its a cycle..\n\n100 pods 100 solo clips, 100 duo clips. right reel ratio this time. then archive the poor ratio ones for a while, then find a way to release without notifying\n\n1,1,do the living doc meta doc for my blog / essays. just make the titles first then get drafting rate how complete / formed i think i articulated my intention\n\nmake 100 short form videos, clips. then start doing podcast and post on youtube, 100 10 minute videos. i consume on youtube so i should also produce on youtube\n\nwhat are good tweet filters? questions that filter before i post? i want to have a high bar for new and existing tweets, a creative menu. generate curate elevate\n\nblog a lot more for practice before tweeting more. each tweet is a blog each blog a tweet. both standalone and relates to other blog posts and other internet links\n\nmusic is also media leverage. what will the new forms of leverage be. questions are buckets waiting for rain. thoughts that havent even entered collective consciousness\n\npod guest list. interview who i follow on X. this is why i want an X export of following and followers app, and i can request certain metrics i guess into a google sheet.\n\nuntil you wake up to sales and notifications, you havent mastered code and media leverage. thread with "point your code and media to each other". thread with naval's post\n\noh you can have different resolutions on the internet, with different audience access. crypto will change this too. soundcloud will be more experimental, spotify is where the cream and polish go..\n\nto solve the smart people are starved. make a super easy way to make a pod. like riverside + descript, super simple and elegant. minimal clicks, super easy to make clips. 1 minute 10 minute 100 minute\n\nalso getting a podcast guest preselects. if hes talking to X market value person, then the podcast host is of that value too. so record the whole pod. clip it chapterize it. tier rank my favs. send those clips. etc\n\npost the clips to youtube and tiktok too. 4 platforms: X IG youtube tiktok. postbridge? with analytics? https://www.perplexity.ai/search/way-to-post-to-youtube-tiktok-r48G3cdJQr2M8Kzupngebw https://www.post-bridge.com/\n\nstarting a media company that solves a top problem is a meta move. solve fame for me and others, solve the attention economy, eyeballs, and it will knock both out. how about the direct sales finder thing. 1 on 1 messages\n\njust record on an X space, then we can edit clips of it out. actually thats why its better to record a private non-live public conversation, so no walls are up. creative control before releasing. 100 1 minute, then 100 10 minute, then 100 100 minute.\n\ni gotta start a pod. remember to have broadcast 1-way on the internet, AND invite a 2-way permissioned engagement, a community. i can be a pillar a lighthouse, i can have dms open etc. have a discord a telegram a whatsapp a calendly a podcast inviter an airchat bubble\n\nstart a minimalist podcast, like danny miranda. just be curious, dont prep, ask good questions. fuck it. be shitty to start, on purpose. the rule is that i have to genuinely want to talk to the person. does it have to be in person. nah. i gotta code too though. code and media\n\ncode first. what if i just kept doing philosophy videos and that will solve debt and sexlessness, just that. combining my 9 years of philosophy with media leverage. plus new code ideas will come with new days and new povs too. dont force it. just solve problems. add good visuals too. ai visuals that are relevant\n\n"building relationships at scale" what does that look like? blog posts, training an ai on my voice and doing audio essays, posting to youtube. setting up a minimalist podcast and posting to spotify and youtube (chapterizing it). following logic and intuition, full body yes's. youtube. instagram, twitter. so thats media\n\nmake those solo clips. upload mig ferdi solo to descript and make clips. make sure its fast and actionable and relevant. topics that are useful, solve problems, and make sure to visually upgrade it. also get the magnet from the tacoma for obings car? something where less road jiggle, and easy to mount, and a good pov for my face on Feb 6, 2025 at 12:30 noon - 1:00 PM\n\ntry podcasting with my fav youtubers. whats the ideamaze here? whats the game plan with being on camera, my voice on internet. whats good internet safety and hygeine rules? nobody cares unless i reach 7 mags and 7 figures lol. you can be safely low for a bit, like tall poppy shit. but whats the plan for when youre on that threshold? slowing down and deleting shit to unfamous yourself? gpt this. its basically all good things till that point huh?\n\nfame through visible competence and permissionless media leverage. be competent first, before visibility. through philosophy, network school, ai workshop, visible competence. fame is the pareto spike, but how? ai visual audio philosophy, on IG and X. come for the stimulation, stay for the timeless wisdom. replicate visual playground. ai voice cloning? solving top problems with permissionless code and media leverage, with my specific knowledge, wrapped in accountability (face, voice, name, etc.)\n\n
