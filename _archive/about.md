Living Life as an Open Book
My full name is Adam Tomas Pangelinan. ATP - like adenosine triphosphate, the energy of the cell. I like my abbreviations.
We compress ourselves for bios, but we are much more than that. Scientist, philosopher, entrepreneur, writer, programmer, investor, musician, artist - why pick just one when life is a magical odyssey to be experienced?

Authenticity Over Everything
Having a clear conscience is priceless. I'm pretty much an open book because authenticity matters more than curation. Better to have content made about you than by you - but sometimes you have to start the conversation yourself.
The thing is, I just wanna share stuff with people. And if I don't have people who wanna hear what I wanna say, I feel ignored. So here we are.

Making Complex Ideas Accessible
I've been working on TNS (The Network State) stuff, and people back home are confused. It's so technical. So I'm making it accessible to a 10-year-old. That's the goal anyway.
I want to have pseudo code, text box, and formal code levels of abstraction available - you should be able to traverse the levels of abstraction based on what you need.

The Autobiography on the Go
I'm gonna write an autobiography anyway, so I might as well document life as I live it. Just guessing and testing. "Talking at the edge of the world" - sharing thoughts as they develop rather than polished final takes.
This is that experiment. Raw, unfinished notes on the journey.

Recent Adventures
Got half of SkillSupply and TownHall done today, revamped AM site. Good shit, Adam Tomas.
Been to some conferences recently - the Don't Die and Network State ones. Planning to write about how those went, break down the expenses and what I learned from each. Why I went, my heroes, why I like them. They can change around.

The Bigger Picture
Children have always worked. They should start working as soon as it's reasonable. Kids should work instead of going to school - if we all were able to provide value, that'd be great.
Sports and music and video games are all symbolic, same for money, for philosophy, for math, for any abstraction. It's all connected.
Life is about living true to yourself, not the life others expected of you. That's number one on the list of regrets people have on their deathbed.

The Mosaic of Life
Curious ~ Empathetic ~ Diligent ~ Honest ~ Ambitious
I'm exploring myself and the world, thanks to life! The USA is amazing. Families are cool to see. The mosaic of life - I'm gonna live it.

This is a living document. Thoughts change, ideas evolve. That's the point.
