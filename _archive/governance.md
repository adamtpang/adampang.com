in benefits, rewarding progress along the values' kpi/s\n\nthe best governance systems of the world, bundle it and be pragmatic along vector value coallition.

this comes back to network states and forking and repo regulation.\n\nfrom the pool of funds made from a network state, how does the leader allocate that capital?

easier to remove than to add\n\nwrite about walkability and order of operations improvements for governance, and public private parttnership plans\n\nbusiness and property rights bound by protection by the state.

how to implement that?\n\nwho is making the repo for the governance of the first network state?\n\nthere are different governance structures, and structures within structures.\n\ngovernance unlocks or traps human potential.

blockchain is a public ledger and everyone can see what happens to everyone\n\nwhy dont we have a leader for a year, prove themselves, then a 2 year leader 3 year, all the way to 10, maybe 30 like lky, and with dont die, 100.

ns and i are working on governance, and we can solve education with internet metaverse, healthcare can be solved with regulation bio innovation\n\njust with the moral thought experiment where you dont see anyone but you still need to design a governance principle.
