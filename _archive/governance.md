Physical Territory Acquisition: Challenge: Crowdfunding and acquiring physical territories that are not contiguous poses logistical, legal, and political challenges. The idea of an "archipelago" of enclaves needs to be reconciled with current international law and local governance. Sources: Srinivasan's own descriptions of network states include this concept, but practical implementation remains speculative.\n\n**3. Community and Governance: Challenge: Building a cohesive community with a shared vision, purpose, and governance structure that can scale is complex. Ensuring participation, avoiding fragmentation, and managing conflicts within a decentralized system are significant bottlenecks. Sources: The need for a clear, collective purpose and governance is emphasized by Srinivasan, with further discussions on the operational aspects in his book and related commentary.\n\nif i became governor of guam with power, id pull a milei or bukele, id make family and friends or connections upset, but itd be the right thing to do in the long run. just like personal finances, government finances are the same. do not spend more than you make. lets cut first because thats immediately in our control, lets get our fundamentals in order. well first let me get wealthy first before doing anything like that lol. there should be a government economic simulator. microeconomics game. search this perplex\n\n
