if i did go to college for engineering, how could i build leverage?

optimize for you alumni network, and therefore location, be it online or offline

jobs are always waiting for you?...


a good career field is marked by how many good problems there are to solve

dont think about careers and majors, think about projects and skills for contribution

i need a plan after singapore. singapore is the unknown. i can do code and media and sales for permissionless leverage. but i might need to go to college in states for advanced engineering somehow

jobs can be schools too

if the job isnt actually what you wanna do, stay away. employee and company should be aligned. unless of course you just gotta take a job to make money. of course do what you gotta do

networking is just meeting people. if you dont genuinely like them. DONT WORK OR TALK TO THEM more than you have to. i feel like business partners should actually be friends too in a way. high integrity high trust

what if I pay a company to work there? just for the experience? talk to the founder to work there for 2 months. what do you get? tacit knowledge, reputation, shows gumption, a missionary not a mercenary

cubicle escape artist

internships, establishing reputation, learning. problem first, demonstrating proof of work

usa tech, where to live, what to learn, how to get money in the meantime. education? how do you get skilled, and what skills are most important? skills feed into solutions for problems. its always problem first. no?

what are the paths before me, school, job, code media, lets see what happens at network state.

i dont NEED to work, i CHOOSE to be fired, or make choices. this reminds me of school, i get cash, and i have to be at a certain place at a certain time, but

am i interviewing or just having a public conversation

im doing a nights and weekends thing, no?

13:17 Slayback critiques the reliance on traditional credentials, advocating for personal branding and showcasing real achievements.

15:31 He highlights the value of taking work off the plates of busy mentors, learning through hands-on experience.

19:56 Slayback advises working for free or taking low-paying jobs if it allows you to learn valuable skills from mentors.

22:52 Slayback advocates for building a vertical network, focusing on connecting with experienced individuals rather than just peers.

maybe companies are the new universities. each is a freshman sophomore junior senior class where you learn. and you can use nights and weekends and permissionless leverage to prove uou know xyz

talk about freelancing and stripe atlas experience

the biggest problem in the macro is how im going to make money after singapore? i need something, a plan i can count on

what do i think my long term plan is?
internship
singapore 2 conferences and network school
code and media permissionless leverage
making money, paying down debt, 1-3 baby steps
leveraging capital with investing in energy gas manufacturing. like do I HAVE to work inside those mission, or can i help allocate for the tech value chain

another strength of mine is internet digging. i can be an investigative journalist or some shii

im dying in day job. my soul!

fullstack human

build the lever to then pull

just learn, follow curiosity. find the gaps in the world that you uniquely can create, leverage, and own

if i did go to college for engineering, how could i build leverage?

i learned hard lessons by trying music and trying tech.
music: i learned that people pay for value
tech: i learned about supply and demand and skill stacking

if i did go to college for engineering, how could i build leverage?

talk about young techies id bet on

jobs are always waiting for you?...

better to be chased for the money than having TO chase

what do i do in life? who can i interview on each front? just do riverside, post to youtube and spotify and x and whatever

i feel dirty with sin and nepotism. im providing value to the company too though...

a good career field is marked by how many good problems there are to solve

just continuously learn in free markets

at least ill be honest on linkedin

im dying in day job. my soul!

new jobs are created just like new companies are created. some will stick around for certain times

im practicing public expression. why? no man is an island, might as well practice. its sales

idk if this is right, but i think getting rid of a minimum wage and instead focus on reskilling resources. but if it can be taught, theres still competition, but tons of needed roles, no? apprenticeships

dont think about careers and majors, think about projects and skills for contribution

automation sucks for people that are stranded, but thats where the importance of reskilling people comes into play

writing online brings people into my headspace and maybe theyll hire me lol

i need a plan after singapore. singapore is the unknown. i can do code and media and sales for permissionless leverage. but i might need to go to college in states for advanced engineering somehow

my history with gatekeeprs and permissioned stuffs. hate it, gonna go side door, circumvent this shit. im getting leverage the permissionless way. the world will open up to me

jobs can be schools too

you still need to work but leverage first

if the job isnt actually what you wanna do, stay away. employee and company should be aligned. unless of course you just gotta take a job to make money. of course do what you gotta do

going for first internet dollar lol. never giving up

i used to be so desperate for a job asking people. i dont like that feeling of being in a permissioned kissass position. im so sorry for those people i asked in neediness, like kasra, bruno, judah hyperdata. its so embarassing lol.

be the best in the world at what you do, keep redefining yourself until this is true. if i code and blog and podcast and hardware manufacturing and music and philosophy and sports, will i be the best in the world at THAT? the combinatorics, and economics

getting a job is permissioned
every transaction is permissioned?
time management

what if I pay a company to work there? just for the experience? talk to the founder to work there for 2 months. what do you get? tacit knowledge, reputation, shows gumption, a missionary not a mercenary

the startup of you. YOU are a product. are you a good product? hows your sales? continous learners in free markets. do what scares you, dont do what you dont want to do.

continuous learners in free markete yo

upskilling

write a what to work on roadmap:
important problems, solutions, team. join or make own? learn skills. generate curate excavate/execute
what are the implications

find a team or make one

learn the skills to contribute. connect the dots

experience/skill * proving > credential
put more life equations

continuous learners in free markets

i couldn't find a job so i made some


clear goals: code and media
why?
money
why?
level up, ill like myself more, better for friends and relationships, no more debt stress. i can leave Guam

the biggest problem in the macro is how im going to make money after singapore? i need something, a plan i can count on

Putting it All Together
Prioritize Scalable Ventures: Focus on building the blog and indie hacking store, as these offer scalability and align with Naval’s advice on permissionless leverage.
Selective Learning: Consider the additive concrete home training if it adds a valuable skill to your portfolio. Weigh the GTA software job against its potential for learning and networking.
Minimize Distractions: Derek’s advice to simplify means only taking on freelance gigs or day jobs if they are directly aligned with your long-term goals.
Long-Term Impact: Keep Peter Thiel’s and Elon Musk’s focus on big-impact projects in mind. Choose ventures that can lead to significant breakthroughs in your field.
Financial Discipline: Pay down your debt following Dave Ramsey’s baby steps, but don’t let the need for immediate cash flow deter you from pursuing high-growth opportunities.

if i was a ceo, sleep would be a cultural priority

talk about recent news with me like incorporating .townhall. trying tons of new physical games. internship ending and singapore plans

what are the paths before me, school, job, code media, lets see what happens at network state.



talk about being from guam and its career challenges, maybe its a good constraint because i really focus on code and media because of it

i dont NEED to work, i CHOOSE to be fired, or make choices. this reminds me of school, i get cash, and i have to be at a certain place at a certain time, but

current cubicle monkey, document life path and each potential branching path

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Soq4gD4tFQM_lxIe3fIgMntYnobHt92V4cAydrqUJnA/edit

just like if you have cash but dont know what to do with it / no plans, same for money. if you dont have a better way to spend your time, get a job.

i want to earn just enough that its higher than my burn (+800$), but i really want time for code and media

im doing a nights and weekends thing, no?

if its friday and youre already dreading monday, thats a bad sign
