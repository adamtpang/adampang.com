equity is a form of leverage. kinda the inverse of capital. you can start with 100% leverage

be authentic AND know what the best problems are. founder, product, market fit. the market is the people who have that problem, the product is the solution

it should look delusional on the surface, but if you have gotten through the first principles idea maze, youre golden. if you have good reason to know this will work, and you have a mission and you know what variables to manipulate to achieve your goal state

resource allocation. what is your lowest resource? time, energy, stress, skill, money, location, relationships? resource transformations?

focus on building the expensive things that are needed, like housing and defense

i feel like when i get my first stripe / lemon squeezy payments, imma cry

i respect atom-entrepreneurs fosho, i just wanted to build leverage first. felt like the better first move

you cant change the shape of the power law, only change its size. increasing is better than decreasing. boom

lets be honest, you want money, is that bad? why does it have such a bad rap? maybe because money is fungible power and short term bad actors can steal kill whatever for it. so ethical is long term? but there will be parasites and bad allocation, "adjustments" as euphamism

excellence through being prolific * high taste * bold sales.

i like thiel because hes both a philosopher and a capitalist

when a blog is done, wrap it up in a book, e book sell via stripe. also sell an mp3, with good tts.

how does geo-arbitrage work? how you can earn in USD and buy tons in asia...

yeah gatekeepers suck. thats where permissionless leverage comes in

how can you build leverage in the best/fastest/cheapest unit of effort per unit time?

figuring out if a project is economically feasible is fun to me. does it check out on paper? component by component

own a leveraged solution to a great problem

noah kagan gots great energy. he doesnt take himself so seriously i admire that.

blueprint should have a spreadsheet with all interventions and costs, then we can sort by cost and you can do it on whatever budget youre on. but also 8020 analyze

entrepreneurship is just-in-time science

intentional mimesis. upfront incentives. as long as youre deliberate. like i want this, because this, because this. be honest. then surround yourself with people who also want that pie, then grow the pie together

how much would elon pay to do all the same things, but he would feel half the stress?

competition is for losers

startup ideas should pass filters, and if you can try to break the idea and it lasts, you gotta do it. are you actually motivated to make it? can you make it? does it actually solve a problem? would you use it? do you believe in it? are you building something that you cant buy? if you are building what already exists, are you just going to undercut?

building wealth means that society owes you in a way, or you can catalyze society to work for you

labor. cut down this forest. you can leave

leverage is like an exoskeleton. you start off with a human body, as you gain more and more leverage, its like you are in a transformer, you get bigger. your judgement suddenly becomes more important because you could do this or this, inaction and opportunity costs emerge

are there more leverage ways than labor capital code and media? its just anything where judgement is a lever so it works while youre not attending to it. BUT you need to actually solve people's problems to provide value to your fellow human. and with media, that builds a reputation and trust with people (so called audience)

talking about naval's frameworks, we wanna get wealthy, but what to do?

talk about positioning high demand low supply through combinatorics. be naval authentic

i love love how noah kagan doesnt take himself so seriously. hes doing great financially AND hes maintained his inner child and energy. its not a mutual exclusive thing

for 50 bucks, ill help you:
- get your name domain

i see things in pipelines, like supply chains / logistics / bottlenecks. so creation, curation, execution is its own chain. i need to execute more.

talk about how its okay to start with zip2 first. elon and adcock both do it. there are good permissionless leverage reasons why starting with software before energy gas manufacturing can be a good decision.

a hackathon is like a game jam, i can see people doing that with music

product * sales

economics is about being useful. building something that others cant, and they pay you. i feel like i have a good understanding of the building blocks of creating wealth. but i gotta code and write more.

build where its most expensive: housing.
look at what you pay for, can you do it better?



immediate feedback: git commits / shipping, sales is feedback. talking to users. question delete optimize accelerate automate

i learned the importance of upfront incentive design

build what you cant buy, buy what you cant build

what if im into saas AND hardtech? am i allowed to exist? lol

economic analysis is feasability analysis.

talk about how code and media is leverage, where even with a small value add, it scales mega. like elon said. you can start with small value huge quantity, andor huge value small quantity.


i mean i wanna do like what elon did and get wealthy with code (permissionless leverage like naval says, along with media to build relationships at scale, like david senra pointed out), then i can work in the atom-tech thats foundational like energy gas manufacturing housing

1,1,so heres the money early game: write and code. then i can go for energy gas manufacturing. like elon, software first. and heres why: software and media are permissionless leverage, then i can get capital and labor for permissioned labor, but i can allocate and use my judgement. software has no marginal cost of replication, so as long as i provide value with my code or media, itll spread like wildfire (at least i hope so). an audience and a reputation is accountable skin in the game

its pretty good to be an entrepreneur or vc because you gotta put your resources where your mouth is, and you got skin in the game

to create wealth. own and be accountable for a leveraged solution to a good problem. relevance

love and marriage are sorta independent, im learning

yeah its pathetic. im a fucking human, i went to a prostitute, i wanted to have sex really badly. is that so fucking bad? its fucking pathetic, and sad yeah... but i fucking ask girls for their number (4 times), i got rejected 4 times, i work on myself, my health, my tech career, im not asking for pity, im just saying 100% ive been trying. ive been taking care of sleep diet exercise, hanging out, building a social circle. i fell into temptation like watching porn, i havent watched in like 3 years or something and im fucking proud of that. but to say that im not supposed to be sexual, thats fucked up, were fucking human, and the only reason were here talking is because our parents were sexual. IM FUCKING SEXUAL AND THATS OKAY. i go to therapy, i gotta talk about this, i gotta work on permissionless leverage. i like girls omg, and thats okay. i dont need to overcorrect for dad, i used to think being sexual was a sin or something, that rings true and makes sense on why i am how i am.

i learned what to be public about and what to be private about

i like a clear clarity plan. clear goals, immediate feedback, challenge skills balance

if we supply good homes for the military, then theyll stop taking more options from the locals. and why is that a problem? well we need meritacratic society for sure, and it doesnt matter if youre a local or a foreigner, we need good standards for all on Guam.

Very interested in energy and manufacturing (foundational tech bottlenecks).

as a dropout, if i were to go to traditional college, what major would i pick? physics/math cant go wrong, but its pretty general. mechanical? nuclear? more specific, lots of physics and math overlap. focus on the best atom-problems first: energy gas manufacturing (advanced and housing)

how to guard against mimesis, examine your motivations. do not look around to others only up to God. well it begs the question what is God? well i think the vague point is more important than an explanation

you can prioritize being low stress first. maybe working hard is lazy in a way, because if theres lack of clarity, youre compensating with "hard work" which is socially acceptable

hard work is not a sufficient variable for financial success

i respect atom-entrepreneurs fosho, i just wanted to build leverage first. felt like the better first move

prime your mind like leaving a bucket out. you cant control the rain but when it comes, your bucket will

im just gonna write what i want, ill make it for me like rick rubin said, and also thats how ill be a magnet for people like me, and vice versa, i gravitate to people i admire. its funny how magnets both attract and repel. polarization is the opposite of the lukewarm, be bolder. why?

go through life story and what i learned from each inflection point. what to do more and less of

lets be honest, you want money, is that bad? why does it have such a bad rap? maybe because money is fungible power and short term bad actors can steal kill whatever for it. so ethical is long term? but there will be parasites and bad allocation, "adjustments" as euphamism

what do i desire? is it my desire or anothers?

a lack of nuanced thought is a bad sign

its like the ethics of the invisible hand. selfish interest that leads to postive outcomes for others. thats good incentive design

scapple why am i doing xyz in life, and examine my life, be real about the reasons

learning is all about relevance

why is attention seeking seen as bad? it feels shallow

competition

being the best does indeed have rewards, but also drawbacks. be authentic then? what if being authentic is not enough? what if someone is better than you on all fronts? what then? what do you do with your life?

why do we want attention?

what does what i talk about say more about me than you?

im practicing public expression. why? no man is an island, might as well practice. its sales

excellence through being prolific * high taste * bold sales.

does jealousy propel our species? status. positive sum wealth. well is it true?

what do you saliently want? why? what is good and evil? why? act along with thinking

i feel permanently tainted by hiring a prostitute. its so sad. a 22 year old virgin thats 5'5.5 in height, in debt, living with mother, living out an oedipal complex, resentful. put the gun down?
are these problems solvable?
i cant go back in time, what can i do to right the wrong?

bias and blind spots are inescapable. we need heuristics though. break your ideas, at least try to, to trust. you can trust what is stress-tested

i hired a prostitute because i was so tired being a virgin, it was like guma' uritao, i wanted to know what it was like. but chamorus were pagan no? what does that mean? how does thinking about these concepts and histories change the way that i live life? is christianity the final religion? time will tell
so what now?

what makes a so called intellectual? isnt it up to the listener to decide. there is no threshold from preartist to artist. its more about action no?

socrates is ugly? lol

is fame a faustian bargain?

i think the seeking, the questioning is exploration

the question is the answer

seperate the person from the idea, like an artist and the song.

time dampens or accelerates

the 4d world plays out in 3d, the 5d world plays out in time

so when we emulate the greco-romans? we find success and a golden age? but how does paganism do with christianity?

i like thiel because hes both a philosopher and a capitalist











consider the counterexamples. why do people do selfless acts. okay if helping the poor is still will to power. is there any thing someone can do that is truly selfless and altruistic without anything will to power-y

stoicism is incomplete. yeah the locus of control is a great coping mechanism and makes sense. but yeah outcomes matter too. inputs and outputs, means and ends BOTH matter. the internal AND the external

sharing online, dunbar's number, combinatorial explosion, and seeing people as objects, because you must at some point

why do i watch others to find what i think? why cant i think for myself on these topics? i guess if i trust a thinker, he can give me thoughts for free, that fit snuggly on my existing framework of the world. if a frame is wrong, you must let it turn to water.

train an ai bot on johnathan bi's transcripts?

when a blog is done, wrap it up in a book, e book sell via stripe. also sell an mp3, with good tts.

is every school of thought bias and mixed, and a yin to the yang is needed to fill the void, and even that has a yin, never the perfect answer in every situation, so a cycle emerges, a recursive morality, built upon humanity's mechanisms and societal psychology

so ambition is just will to power?

become sharp so you can be powerful AND good

study nietzsche's life itself. i admire his boldness

a great critique creates nuance in a theory

religion appeals to psychological needs

why are you listening to me? have i achieved what you are after?

but does it resonate?
but what does that mean for YOU?

johnathan bi is underrated. hes like peterson without the anger

not in kind but in degree

it is not the end of history. and that can be scary and exciting at the same time. change is upon us

will something rather than nothing


karl popper got falsifiability so right. what test would prove that nietzsche's will to power is the "right" framework to live by?

the buffet, the hallway of different world religions and ways of being. can we pick and choose? to create a new way? i think the multiplicity is good for the consumer, have multiple schools of thought and let time be the real test. that is darwinian.






these great thinkers are people too. you are a person. what do you think? if it makes sense then follow it. make sure to not destroy the means of error correction: experiments, dialogue, first principles, emotional disaster prep. when emotions run high, and blood boils, morals can be thrown out easily

i havent been able to break darwinian morality. it can hold christianity and paganism no?


modernity feels more pagan than Christian

the will to power is real
yeah im selfish at least right now. i see both sides. pagan and christian

i should learn more nietzsche


generate: speed and volume
curate: if there is doubt there is no doubt
excavate: push it to others

just like in code, use the most abstracted functions and languages, as is reasonable. only go deep when the gist doesnt cut it


christianity and johnathan bi


myths contain messages not doctrins

Christ exposed our sins. love thy neighbor, unconditionally. this is the message of dostoevsky as well. it only counts if it costs

i grew up in Christianity, after exploring other religions, i still like Christianity the most

how do you hide harsh transformative truths? through fiction, through fools, through complexity

so Christianity was a different algorithm than pagan religions? brain software is collective belief of the superorganism

how does geo-arbitrage work? how you can earn in USD and buy tons in asia...

girard came up with a great theory that explains anthropological, political, economic phenomena

to be able to render intelligible

you always understand more than you are able to speak

import all "@"keeps. gotta distill too

the fastest way to get out of your head is to go into your body

so communism paganizes christianity... wow. thats like i = e^2, but philosophical

johnathan bi is top tier ngl. i was skeptical at first and lowjey jealous, but hes great

unwavering unconditional love is the way out of the mimetic process

different religions are like

did i want to be tainted? to NOT be innocent?

8vs johnathan bi, joe lonsdale, peter thiel, david perell, peterson, tyler cowen

violence is blind

idk if this is right, but i think getting rid of a minimum wage and instead focus on reskilling resources. but if it can be taught, theres still competition, but tons of needed roles, no? apprenticeships

add some, remove some. or a lot

is violence curation? is violence needed for curation or is mere economics a good enough curator of genetics?

to people-watch, and pretend im not one of them

if you are not satisfied, the art is not finished

do not look around to others, only up to God

every Westerner bathes in the waters of Christianity

the ethics of prostitution. will i still punish myself for that in 30 years? am i permanently tainted? lets learn and do

put a pic to every blog post, like david perell

advice cancels to zero. its the tool you need at the right time, and youre a unique person different from others

does everybody have a suicide threshold? an amount of pain that is unbearable. on the flip side, does everybody have a sword they can arm themselves with against that? meaning to keep you going religiously?

we create new myths with shows and anime

naruto is so jungian. only when naruto integrates with his literal inner demon, is when he unlocks kyuubi mode

create ai images for the blog

solarpunk aesthetics

we hide and hide. weaknesses. streissand effect
timesheet
nobody would be the same if they could afford to be different. if the agent could overpower the arena
what lies am i unanimously complicit in?

if being good is not enough, power is whats needed. will to power. so nietzsche is just right?
im learning truths stronger than my previous beliefs, and the vision is not exactly positive.
is it cynicism masquerading as rationality?
or is it deep truths about humanity's inner world?
or something else altogether?

i would be different with power and so would you, no? i guess well only know with a test


make a reading list. i dont read often, but ive learned summaries from certain books

we are both spirited animals and rational agents

well how else am i going to live?

everyone whose put their heart on show has been crucified

i feel so conflicted. ive sinned, i dont think i believe in the dogma of christianity but im still so troubled by it. maybe i do need to go to therapy. but what happens when i exhaust all the times? i feel less empowered

the axis is powerful and powerless
good and evil
power is your abillity to apply force
will to live
sin and crime
powerful can commit great deeds AND great evils

johnathan bi, peterson, lonsdale seem similar. well dressed intellectual

what is courage?
should i hide what i say?
should i say what i think?
should i embarass myself on purpose?



im a future scapegoat

what are my meaning answers to the meaning questions?

genetic weights like a neural net, but a genetic net of skillpoints like in an rpg, a starting archetype, predispositions

vice-signalling. special mark, near AND far from social order

violence is blind

if youre a nerd getting cought up in society and not prepared, dont kill yourself like aaron swartz

babel is unanimous, and therefore fragile

the lie of degree not kind. the lie lies in its unanimity. johnathan bi

sometimes in philosophy, you must get your hands dirty. ethics

learn from people you hate / biased against. can i learn from a college educated person. its a challenge

laws of physics, laws of people: mimesis, hypergamy

what problem/s does religion solve?

https://chatgpt.com/c/65b7a15c-d596-4ae9-9ab5-1f7b9c115e00

hedonic treadmill. so meaning. you wont find a satisfying propositional answer. its about how, feel, play

money reduces # of sad days, but wont INCREASE # of happy days. meaning > happiness

nobody would be the same if they could afford to be different. arena shaping us

positive constraints

it is through the testing that you will find your own unique path

think about the long game

have people know your name, not your face

filter the audience

why am i doing this? the unexamined life is not worth living

i want to build leverage
i want to build relationships at scale
i want to talk to and meet like-minded people online and offline

could this bite me in the butt? does this create anxiety sharing? is this evergreen? just archive and gitignore, dont delete

do you want your search history public? how much should you share?

played spyfall and mafia

if there is doubt there is no doubt, get rid get rid

secret truths and fictions

curate and remove doubtful posts to reduce anxiety. be strategic in what i share. i can always share again


what is time to profitability for each project. upfront costs divided by profit

i love scapple, add to tools and show cgrome extensions

remove bad indiehack ideas i wouldnt use

what will be the next thing after blockchain and ai

dont think about careers and majors, think about projects and skills for contribution

OH MY FUCKING GOD: star farms (nuclear or solar), connect to sabatier machines and bitcoin mining rigs (sucks up all the volatility). i can do this on a smaller scale. what other star-farm-connectors / lego blocks can there be??????

traits i admire in others: not take themselves so seriously, love noah kagan and tim ferriss about that. self-deprecation sometimes idk

i love seeing when my heroes interact. here are some links. list subheroes too like huberman, casey

as long as you disagree with parts of your heroes, you know youre safe from mimetic downsides

cant doxx me if i doxx myself lol, the 8mile defense is voluntary vulnerability

the best areas are the frontier, with no map, and you need correct axioms to derive first principles solutions where there are no easy answers

if you want to see who rules over you, see who you cant criticize, like parents

humor is awesome, the fool and the king

words first. courage speech vision all in one. action. writing is thinking, no? its clarity-smithing

doing makerspace hardware. learning 3d printing electronics mechatronics + software AI. hardware is hard holy shit, need a compelling mission like energy gas manufacturing (housing / defense) for real dopamine unlocks

how will you allocate your time, money, stress, dopamine?

evil is often insidious, not upfront

idk if it was jung but i think he would have his patients just ramble, then patterns would emerge, same thing im trying with the blog. im just gonna ramble, then ill consolidate, then ill clean up thoughts, itll get better and better but at least im starting. letting the perfectionist in LATER

what do you do when even in a platonic ideal, theres no consensus?

after cleaning, point to best blog posts on twitter

noone chose their ethnicity

bad nepotism is bad because unequal opportunities. bad nepotism defined as a candidate was not let in because of corruption. but if the relative is actually competent, reach a threshold of competence, its fine, no?

yeah gatekeepers suck. thats where permissionless leverage comes in

positive sum ethical games

of the network state dashboard, whos the closest to balaji's vision of the first network state? what are the sufficient variables and whats the progress on each front?

accountability and free markets and free speech

network states can have minimal law, passport benefits, some kind of taxation and benefits from diff companies

i like the bryan johnson way, like just follow the data. if the means gives better data outcomes, then sure, do that, but if not, ill stick to this

socrates was always like: "but how is that relevant TO YOU?"

prostitution, guma' uritao, taboos, the shadow, the sopranos

so many single guys struggling, like me

emergent properties gotta be a wonder of the world. file this under awe insights. talk about the living chain from the first life forms to us. our ancestors got this far, its our turn to hold the candle and not let the candle of life go out

the more material wealth, the more life possible, remember that humans are both matter and what matters. we need food (matter), shelter (matter), these physical resources

the idiot index: getting cost down to the price of material constituants + IP price. and even then, there are ways to bring the supply of material constituatnts up

automation sucks for people that are stranded, but thats where the importance of reskilling people comes into play

capitalism is an/THE engine of economic growth

why are mixed kids so beautiful. i think theyre so cool.


thiel says psychology is a poor substitute for religion

Jesus is the ultimate scapegoat? because he didnt deserve it

make it TXitter

results validate

noone can insult me better than me lol, i know my lowest points

validation from results from action from smallness

talk about the best of the twitter experiment, twitter curate. curation is thoughtful and useful

3 writing sessions done

maybe i gotta push my code and media to accelerate the leverage. be known well.


library kids: elon, bill gates, naval, visa. reading purist NAH. check my store for pdf to mp3

if youre not willing to risk embarassment and mistake, then youll never know if you could do that thing you wanna do, be that person you wanna be, no?

add pics. where to host? just link to it in markdown

not well known, but known well. accountable. skin in game, like reputation

we are collectively writing the newest testemant. when did we stop writing testaments. someone should curate the bible, modernize it / more accessible, and update a new testament VERY carefully. a new project that incorporates vervaeke and petersonian ideas. make it open source where it can fork and shit



nepotism at GPA

i love being honest, but i wont share secrets unless i forget. the truth will set us all free. truth can be ugly

i hired a prostitute just like in the sopranos

talk about good shows like sopranos GOT breaking bad, and animes.

shawshank is more like a biblical parable

you dont need to write down self-reminding tasks: brush teeth, do laundry, wash dishes

as long as i progress on the important life dimensions i prioritize, i can take a lot more bullshit life throws me. but if im stagnating, i feel like shit and the bullshit hurts way way more. get the fundamentals right

my full name is adam tomas pangelinan. ATP / adenosine triphosphate, the energy of the cell. AP means advanced placement. i like my abbreviations

anxiety and voluntary approach. doing what scares you. dont do unnecessary stuffs but when something you know you gotta do, and can do, do it.

figuring out if a project is economically feasible is fun to me. does it check out on paper? component by component

writing online brings people into my headspace and maybe theyll hire me lol

you can have multiple motivations to do something. like how ill play badminton cause its a novel exercise, its social, and its good IG fuel. why IG? social validation

how can you build leverage in the best/fastest/cheapest unit of effort per unit time?

jordan peterson is so funny sometimes when he gets mad

a ton of things boil down to product * sales. how good the thing is (quality) times how many people purchase / know (quantity)

strong and good

ethics is about good and evil, and therefore life and death

for life story, show thought process. get the dates sorta right, memory a bit foggy

i see both sides, sometimes going harder or going softer is the way. there is no one way, no free lunch, just obstacles, tools, and experiments. knowns and unknowns, positive and negative, life and death, good and evil. its all connected, yin and yang

relationships are built on bids for attention, and those bids met

why do humans want attention? its sales?
moves, like tech, but GOT?

damn tech makes me think in sociopathic ways sometimes

how much SHOULD you share online

anyone played millsberry?

why does american politics feel like peak el clasico? lol

my dad being an addict makes me feel like marceline that loves simone, but the crown makes him do stuff. and idk if its just drugs or underlying whatevers

i wanted to see if they would still love me even with my worst act


public categorized notes to self and others. like a half blood prince notebook for others a cheatsheet

should be a daily bible like daily stoic, accessible

own a leveraged solution to a great problem

seperate doubts from surefire posts. i can always add back

ask 1517 how the dropout community can meet irl, make real friends


media is for leverage but also to let like minded people find me instead of just me finding MEs

go as fast as you can, in a way you can do for a long time. prep for the marathon, sprint when you can

before you compete, do you even want the prize on offer? look at worst downside best upside. thats the risk spread in a way idk

algorithms
- binary search for youtube / netflix
- pagerank for things that feed into each other: energy gas manufacturing (housing(additive))

- i pat myself twice whenever i see myself doing something long term good. self-rewarding skinner style

guam

psychadelics
- terrrence mckenna
- one high dose psilocybin
- its not a panacea, set and setitng really do matter
- import notes
- i researched for a week. its safe, its a whole other category of drug
- its the nuclear of psychonautics (can be super useful, terrible PR)

defense tech has funding from government and new physical and software tech. i mean it does protect against america lowkey an s tier mission. we cant get longevity manufacturing energy gas space without USA staying intact from within and without. anduril would be a great move.

learn the first principles of the wealth game you can rederive the solution in a free market environment with some time

i remember watching all TWICE MVs, going through LOONA in order, good times. 2nd gen and early 3rd gen. nostalgia overload

if its not economically viable now, its hard to keep it sustainably goin

for what would i be willing to die for today?

dying for the greater good. the means and ends both matter

ill spend on needs, health, books, business investments

podcast is called "superorganism"

schools got it backward, like elon said, teach to the problem, not the tool. learning and flow is all about relevance, and certain triggers: clear goals, immediate feedback, challenge skills balance. maths is relevant WHEN its relevant, when it comes into play for your mechanical engineering project

one of the sucky things about atoms is that you need cash to get started for the audacious projects, not tryna make excuses, just noting the difference between bits. but the world will change

generation (male), selection (females), is how the humanity superorganism

my history with gatekeeprs and permissioned stuffs. hate it, gonna go side door, circumvent this shit. im getting leverage the permissionless way. the world will open up to me

noah kagan gots great energy. he doesnt take himself so seriously i admire that.

doing only what you want is being authentic and will guide you to whats play to you, work for others, or just a fun thing. youll know

curation makes it easier to sift. imagine a chef that curates menu a writer that curates their essays a musician that curates their songs etc.

jobs can be schools too

needs to be advanced cause small scale

what if we just bought shipping housing from china (manufacturing behemoth) then put in backyard like cover then i just live there? / on family land. like how much would it cost for concrete?

can laypeople use dapps without opening a metamask ETH wallet?

to a sensitive person, theres so much thats fuckin salient, for better or worse. like blackbeard, double power, double pain

show routine:

never ship, never know

one of the great thing about travel is that people dont have expectations of you, you can be as tabula rasa societally as you can

if you get to the essence, you can have conviction as long as you got the axioms right, you can rederive life solutions

instead of "phone, say text" add telegram?

put photos of me on personal site, gallery.

consolidate, like bring links out to the main page, less clicks, but more overwhelm...

Network States: New forms of governance and community organization that operate on blockchain principles, with potential applications in citizenship, law, and infrastructure (e.g., Balaji Srinivasan's concept of network states).


with keeps, i write subroutines for myself. is wisdom not a more and more nuanced decision tree? like a neural net

if i was running a show, id want to plan the whole thing out, then actually manifest it with clear vision, and to not get bored, id do a ton of em

what else could we know, us, the superorganism, an offshoot of life

human printing in the future? we could just print humans??? if it does not break the laws of physics

our genes go through male and female manifestations through time. maybe thats why the anima animus, ying yang has an 8020 split.

blueprint should have a spreadsheet with all interventions and costs, then we can sort by cost and you can do it on whatever budget youre on. but also 8020 analyze

entrepreneurship is just-in-time science


talk about important topics even if its embarassing or scary to.

you still need to work but leverage first

make the batch script convert any link to its markdown equivalent. fix the spacing and line breaks

music is media which is leverage. basically the internet is leverage, internet first. balaji

this isnt a hardship contest. thiel.

curate when theres clearly too much generation

evolution is deviation selection. thats literally males females


put nav buttons on sides of posts

if the job isnt actually what you wanna do, stay away. employee and company should be aligned. unless of course you just gotta take a job to make money. of course do what you gotta do

going for first internet dollar lol. never giving up

sandoval yarning

with every ai tool, theres an api cost. as long as CAC < CLV, youre cherry

free markets are error correcting for under over allocation

intentional mimesis. upfront incentives. as long as youre deliberate. like i want this, because this, because this. be honest. then surround yourself with people who also want that pie, then grow the pie together

i used to be so desperate for a job asking people. i dont like that feeling of being in a permissioned kissass position. im so sorry for those people i asked in neediness, like kasra, bruno, judah hyperdata. its so embarassing lol.


how much would elon pay to do all the same things, but he would feel half the stress?

how do you grandfather in urban design? do you have to reform the existing or start a new thing?

competition is for losers

startup ideas should pass filters, and if you can try to break the idea and it lasts, you gotta do it. are you actually motivated to make it? can you make it? does it actually solve a problem? would you use it? do you believe in it? are you building something that you cant buy? if you are building what already exists, are you just going to undercut?

only ask of people what youd do OR if they actually like to do it

software isnt the end game, hardware is.

building wealth means that society owes you in a way, or you can catalyze society to work for you

if a lot of divorces happen over money, then of course money is a great way to start a relationship, or atleast make it so that money isnt an issue to starting a relationship

all advice cancels to zero, this is the invisible calculus. advice cancels to zero, but wealth can be positive sum of course, we do more with less, lest were still cavemen

only read the book if the compressions dont get the gist across. unless its entertaining to you of course

be tru to yourself

be the best in the world at what you do, keep redefining yourself until this is true. if i code and blog and podcast and hardware manufacturing and music and philosophy and sports, will i be the best in the world at THAT? the combinatorics, and economics

i dont like people who play status games. is that just because im low status, and me saying that is a status move? damn im fucked lol

rate my own essays / blog posts, color code, point to the best ones on IG and twitter


would you travel here if you couldnt take pics and post on ig? its a status thing. like you can afford shit. wealth not status. real friends, owning a real


if your idea is already built, thats a good thing, the world has that thing. keep looking out for new good problems to solve. up and up the tech stack!

networking is just meeting people. if you dont genuinely like them. DONT WORK OR TALK TO THEM more than you have to. i feel like business partners should actually be friends too in a way. high integrity high trust

im disciplined diligent sorta lazy, and disciplined.

fix i say this to myself spacing

make markdown spacing better w pandoc

leverage is like with greater power comes greater responsibility


this isnt a hardship contest lol. pain still sucks no matter who experiences it. eustress is good, not involuntrary distress

just take a bunch of pics and some will be worthwhile to post

how would v1 companies you like look in your idea spreadsheet? is there something about the idea? upfront execution yes. value add

The story till the state is good

just do 1 step. make the goals clear, immediate feedback (pat pat), challenge skills balance. do it the easy way, but go long on this path, be durable and endure. spread the stress over time

speed, volume, minimal to the finish line. i think it could be value, try to sell it to people and help em. try small price first on stripe, goes to novo business bank

media is selling, coding is building

so many people show themselves online and they dont die

coding your life algo for the right outcomes you want

what if I pay a company to work there? just for the experience? talk to the founder to work there for 2 months. what do you get? tacit knowledge, reputation, shows gumption, a missionary not a mercenary

the startup of you. YOU are a product. are you a good product? hows your sales? continous learners in free markets. do what scares you, dont do what you dont want to do.

podcasts have network effects for the guests, start small

what they do not say. what they do when people aren't looking, when theyre in power

endurance / durability are top rate traits

if an ADHD tries to focus on 1 thing that they dont want to, they get 3/10 done. if they just do what they want, including sometimes that task, it'll be at least 5/10 done. it's the variety that catalyzes momentum/motivation

gpt is great, its just like google personifed

the more authentic you are to you, the less competition

cmprssn/curation

with every schooling, youre competing with the fellow students

keep searching, when you find it, youll know. youll fuckin know

so i know software a fair bit, i eventually wanna learn hardware but its very capital intensive to learn. i mean i can apply for grants to run experiments, and maybe that can get me an internship. but i think with software, small value at scale means tons of capture value, but with hardware, i think you gotta work on advanced manufacturing thats super useful to people, so that you can get high value low supply (hard to make things)



to play the metagame well, when you reach the s tier of a game, you must quit... BECAUSE... theres the meta game to play, not the mini game

making money, paying down debt, 1-3 baby steps
leveraging capital with investing in energy gas manufacturing. like do I HAVE to work inside those mission, or can i help allocate for the tech value chain

venture capital is lowkey the best charity. net positive for both

put empathy into sales. would you buy this if you were them?

its ok to do software first, even elon did it

add analytics

talk about psychadelics

theres so much OFFLINE
imagine the new people that are coming online, new people being born, more life, more prosperity and meaning.

death. like if we just go to sleep and dont wake up. so theres no need to fear death?

sustainable wealth creation

why do people not talk about money? to prevent envy or judgement? i really dont wanna spread luxury beliefs

another strength of mine is internet digging. i can be an investigative journalist or some shii

leverage is like an exoskeleton. you start off with a human body, as you gain more and more leverage, its like you are in a transformer, you get bigger. your judgement suddenly becomes more important because you could do this or this, inaction and opportunity costs emerge

do it at speed volume cheap relevant. what i want to do.

every transaction is positive sum no? the buyer thinks this thing in front of them is worth the price, and the seller things this thing is worth letting go for the price. they both think its the right decision, FOR THEM. people have different needs


being wrong is a good thing. better to know truth always, even if it costs you, because its an ROI in long term truth

career science. what are the axiomatic fundamentals of building wealth

are there more leverage ways than labor capital code and media? its just anything where judgement is a lever so it works while youre not attending to it. BUT you need to actually solve people's problems to provide value to your fellow human. and with media, that builds a reputation and trust with people (so called audience)

there are no rules except physics -musk and deutsch

talk about books i know about / listened to / skimmed. i dont like reading purists, i like audible.

when you learn, your vocab and axiomatic frameworks change

would I watch this?

i can always do part 2s

i can do profiles on my heroes, talking about it with fellow nerds




have a plan AND experiment, espeically with gatekeepers. go through side gate. like agario, grow so you can consume the thing.

youre never late, maybe for a local minima, but never for the global. the ever expanding puzzle of life

topics to talk about:
sport
philosophy/meaning
music
technology: hardware and software

trim the chapters. like rick rubin, do it for me, listen to noone else? i mean trust yourself, and your ignorance...

so post on spotify, youtube, twitter, through anchor/spotify podcasters?

humans have survived without christianity. what did the ancients do for meaning. not that i dont like christianity, i do. i see religions like multiple languages pointing to the same thing. its so weird when language A has a word that doesnt translate to language B, its like langauge B people just havent thought about that concept based on the bounds of their language. so sometimes we borrow words from different languages

just do it shittily, ask questions, be relevant, dont prep just talk.

talk about positioning high demand low supply through combinatorics. be naval authentic

the blogging and podcast ideas energizes me. i gotta code though too for the network state. lets walk through townhall. what would i use it for? just talking about guam? go for volume and speed and relevance, edit later

the most contrarian thing of all is to think for yourself, not oppose the crowd

talking about naval's frameworks, we wanna get wealthy, but what to do?

leverage value first, then capture some of the value. be useful is a good heuristic

these tiny twitter and blog experiments build my confidence for bigger experiments like podcasting

i dont want to just talk, i wanna do stuff in tech. bringing value in tech to the masses. code and advanced manufacturing. energy gas manufacturing

do a talk with people i wanna talk to. parse ig twitter linkedin

sometimes i see the world and its so futuristic in some ways, and in other

building relationships at scale

its dialogos

just being myself, always trying to improve. never giving up. smart not hard. being courageous

i wanna be systematic with my life. the unexamined life is not worth living so they say...

start a minimalist podcast, like danny miranda. just be curious, dont prep, ask good questions. fuck it. be shitty to start, on purpose. the rule is that i have to genuinely want to talk to the person. does it have to be in person. nah. i gotta code too though. code and media

i wanna be charged up from network state


YOOOOOO im gonna see balaji, bryan johnson, and HUBERMAN!!!, and vitalik too love you bby lol


add comments?

put a pic of me on personal site

reverse engineer why X person, doing Y thing, worked.

as long as you reach the a-s tier, no need to worry about rank if you fall into the good bucket. do not look around to others, only look up to God

i mean this is to be expected. with great power comes great responsibility. and if everyone got famous, you, theres a bigger target, because theres more security needed

i love love how noah kagan doesnt take himself so seriously. hes doing great financially AND hes maintained his inner child and energy. its not a mutual exclusive thing

just get to tier no need to spend the diminishing returns. bronze in all categories combinatorics

now i see pain as plasticity for a neural net, it has meaning for problem solving


analogize to a dunbar village tmi online

if there is even 1 counterexqmple, that wasnt a sufficient variable

its pretty crazy how species branch off from one another with time and deviation. like edo period. we cant mate with chimps. humanity is on its own when it comes to species. homo sapiens

what does your inner critic say? if you can provide counter examples youre good, if not, you got hw

podcast as therapy alternative? lol


positive constraint

i guess for tmi im only saying online what id say to a stranger?

start adding links like bjork introducing aphex

thoughts die so we dont

find advanced manufacturing bootcamp?

if you dont believe in it, dont do it

if you can ignore the solution, it wasnt a big problem

small experiments. just see if x will work, have a backup plan. fearset shit.

we dont have emotions, they have us.

i get bored with certain sports / groups of people. maybe i just want novelty. so im trying a bunch of different social sports, physical > digital games. good heuristics that i can live by

the big problems are cheap housing singapore and how to make money after singapore. im in debt, if im gonna work a job i better be learning something useful. maybe i can have a mixed approach where i apply to jobs online AND i work on my side things. do i work with people on guam? twitter? im not the best coder, but maybe i can be low supply high high demand (good positioning) through combinatorics.


solve a good problem, then try to get time again. output should be time disconnected, just judgement

clean up youtube titles

it has to click for me

which is the better problem to solve for fellow humans?

i like it when tech is tied to ethics, i can get behind that

what is a mistake anyway? falling short of a goal because of lack of knowledge or skill, both of which can be bettered












if it does not break the laws of physics, it is possible

do not destroy the means of error correction

many mistakes, but revivable and resilient. little mistakes, but destroyed when the flood comes

how would a real network state look like? like a paid monthly passport, benefits of being a part, vetted.

i notice that so much of what i think is foundationed in others' thoughts. so whats mine? maybe its just the superorganism

fix the mantras spacing. fix pandoc

caffiene up, more focus energy anxiety, lesser sleep
caffiene down, more depression, less anxiety, better sleep

new cool logo, do the anchor? yeah. anchor marianas anchor

what do you want, what are the bottlenecks

oscillate between code and media. blog post a day, github commit a day on the relevant topic on the relevant project. the reason why this first before hardware is because its permissionless leverage. i mean i can learn hardware but i feel like id have to go to advanced manufacturing first since the scaling part is uber suck, like elon said. energy, gas, manufacturing houses like cover. but how do they differentiate.

i grew up on kongregate

be a multipreneur to practice meta orchestration

learning is about relevance

balance learning and doing

am i divergent because i just am or did i choose to, i wanted to be different? different doesnt mean good or bad it just means different. i deviate sometimes by nature, sometimes by choice

talk about being off socials whole life then now on socials. i didnt want to get famous, i didnt identify like that, like a popular jock person, i was more smart artsy, but now im more into extroverted athletic stuff too. i wanna live a full life


gaiman boredom


humanity is like a superorganisms

continuous learners in free markete yo

critique my heroes
even in the people who i like, i can easily find things i dont like. so it makes sense why we dont like ourselves too. things to work on

talk about fun facts or quirks, like every time i do something im proud of i pat myself twice

post my teachers teachers

therapy

wanting people to like me

talking or learning without action is cowardice

cowardice as morality.

deviation selection

clear conscience priceless

pain is plasticity

if not this, then what?

if garry tan says theres too much money in the world + thiel's communism no idea conspiracy. how do we create new knowledge, ethics points us in the right direction, procedural deutschian knowledge is how to get there

put google analytics on my site

gatekeepers.

great tech media: bloomberg ashlee vance, s3

keep talking about things relevant to me, till ive said what i wanted to say

why not twitter? i dont want to force feed info to people

books
anime
film/shows

why is your only reference other people whove done xyz, you gotta think 1st principles and derive Godly solutions to Devilish problems

the goal is input and output DISCONNECTED. use leverage so your judgement is the real factor. smarts * wisdom

make arrow buttons on left and right of bottom of each  to navigate between posts

if i can ignore the solution, its not a problem

talk about what id identify with: music philosophy writing technology (software hardware bioware)

how was stripe atlas
how was the 3d printer / atdm / makerspace
how was the singapore trip? capsule hotel? worth it?

shares in people? blockchain?


i and others can be so cruel, pretentious, etc. we are capable of great good and bad

write a what to work on roadmap:
important problems, solutions, team. join or make own? learn skills. generate curate excavate/execute
what are the implications

where to live, not where do you live

just "music"

exercising with others has accountability built in, and its much more motivating in the long run. same with working. cafes can be a bummer though. its so much easier to work when others are working around you. the social context matters so much psychologically

indiehcakers i like

add an easy dm option at the bottom of each essay, so people can contact me from there. figure how thatll work. gpt it. add it to batch script. or actually just use an embed somehow. an email embed??? from who, what the message is.

sometimes, thinking doesnt lead you to the answer. bottom 3Ps

this is my fate, i love it

list salient problems:
i want to move but
why?
flight and housing is expensive
i need more cash

hypothesize solutions

find a team or make one

learn the skills to contribute. connect the dots



saying no can be so hard but its a skill to build, no?

accountability under my own name. skin in the game

through volume and taste, you will become less shit. i just wont give up

experience/skill * proving > credential
put more life equations

my mongo to gundo plan

time energy emotions

i see things in pipelines, like supply chains / logistics / bottlenecks. so creation, curation, execution is its own chain. i need to execute more.

because ai is solving problems for people, nvidia is MORE in demand.
demand is created when a new means of problem solving appears

who is doing code and media well: pieter levels, marc lou, jedcal


i dont ask for money, ask for advice. only ask for money when accelerating. when you've exhausted all no-money experiments for what youre trying to do.

does this drain me or energize me? your subconscious might know. even if something is hard, if it energizes me, go do that

do not look around to others, only up to God - thiel

power law

laws of physics and people


put on txitter that im in my patent clerk era

reach out to twitter ig linkedin txitter

talk about how its okay to start with zip2 first. elon and adcock both do it. there are good permissionless leverage reasons why starting with software before energy gas manufacturing can be a good decision.

what thoughts are my own if i just learn from others?

unitree the best?

talk about procrastination

a hackathon is like a game jam, i can see people doing that with music

product * sales

what is salient? is a great question to just map out what's going on with your life

build things thatd be valuable to you, and as you expand, the list of things thatd be valuable to you EXPANDS

run each blog post through gpt

i gotta stop saying yes to things i cant keep. makes me feel horrible letting people down. i want people to like me. why? maybe its just an innate social interest

remove topics that aren't evergreen material

economics is about being useful. building something that others cant, and they pay you. i feel like i have a good understanding of the building blocks of creating wealth. but i gotta code and write more.

plan learn build show tell

i couldn't find a job so i made some

why do we want money? to pay bills, to travel. why? to live,

build where its most expensive: housing.
look at what you pay for, can you do it better?

"tXitter"

talk about foundational tech like energy gas manufacturing

vice signalling. list my vices to build trust. why do i want to build trust?
talk about addiction, and practical steps. what ive learned about addiction

delete by topic first, add new ones. color code based on how ready they are. add relevant emojis to each title, shorten titles

the best strategy is the sustainable one

fulfill social commitments: JR and aydin gokce, then meta commitments from keeps

often i forget insights. i started forgetting memories at 17, maybe i filled up my brain. i like how the human mind autoforgets, its like LIFO, use it or lose it. pain is plasticity, going deeper into the training of the neural net, backprop, forward prop. idk what im talking about when it comes to AI. stop reading me, what are you doing with your life? this is not relevant

unfinished projects are like unfinished books. its okay. just return to it when you need to. you dont HAVE to force discipline and all that. i like discipline and diligence over the long haul, project management and cooperating with your past present and future selves, over time, with different frames and frame breaks, when discipline makes sense, youll know deep down

if you can ignore the solution, it wasnt a real problem






clear goals: code and media
why?
money
why?
level up, ill like myself more, better for friends and relationships, no more debt stress. i can leave Guam

immediate feedback: git commits / shipping, sales is feedback. talking to users. question delete optimize accelerate automate

challenge skills balance:






dont do what you dont want to. if its clearly a good decision, fully aligned, its just courage you need, nothing more.






make apps that i can stand behind



add google analytics

i learned the importance of upfront incentive design

"chat with me" calendly

build what you cant buy, buy what you cant build

marc lou: never ship, never know

so the daily game is. 1 blog post, 1 commit

if you dont wanna do it, dont do it. do something else in the same vein

i feel so fuckin miserable. why? money, no concrete plan after singapore. more debt, no girlfriend, little friends. so what?

you can be novel in aggregation. no new lego blocks, but a new combination, a new potion

what if im into saas AND hardtech? am i allowed to exist? lol

delete the weird blogs

be useful

put my DMs at the end of every blog post. how? email, phone number? dm me wherver

talk is cheap, actions and reality stress test your thoughts. experiment, fearset

why is feelings non-masculine? im lowkey more sensitive than my sisters, what am i supposed to do? maybe the fact that im asking the question is not masculine. why do i care about being masculine? insecurity, i want a girlfriend, but first I gotta like me. do the things so that I like I

i like systematic, rigorous thinking about salient life

"why im blogging and not tweeting" idk if im wrong, maybe i can balance these

economic analysis is feasability analysis.

my posts will get more nuanced over time, itll get cleaned up, noise will turn to signal. i should trim the titles too. i should put emojis in title.

validation from results from action from smallness

the biggest problem in the macro is how im going to make money after singapore? i need something, a plan i can count on

how open should i be?

i feel like a kid: why? im short (5'5.5) im living with my mom, im sometimes needy, i havent succeeded with money, i have little real good friends (arguably 1). i need to improve. money muscles calmness

naval said it best. if you talk to enough people, read enough books, do mushrooms, meditate enough, you realize its all connected, dont box yourself in, be a natural philosopher

gpt is a soundboarding

list my monthly burn and talk about dave ramsey

Putting it All Together
Prioritize Scalable Ventures: Focus on building the blog and indie hacking store, as these offer scalability and align with Naval’s advice on permissionless leverage.
Selective Learning: Consider the additive concrete home training if it adds a valuable skill to your portfolio. Weigh the GTA software job against its potential for learning and networking.
Minimize Distractions: Derek’s advice to simplify means only taking on freelance gigs or day jobs if they are directly aligned with your long-term goals.
Long-Term Impact: Keep Peter Thiel’s and Elon Musk’s focus on big-impact projects in mind. Choose ventures that can lead to significant breakthroughs in your field.
Financial Discipline: Pay down your debt following Dave Ramsey’s baby steps, but don’t let the need for immediate cash flow deter you from pursuing high-growth opportunities.

i want harder in the paint IG songs. im super happy go lucky music lol

talk about in format how im making the urls short. sivers inspiration

a big part of the meaning crisis is reconnecting to body, and flow of course.

take moonshots and regular shots.

talk about how code and media is leverage, where even with a small value add, it scales mega. like elon said. you can start with small value huge quantity, andor huge value small quantity.

do you work on foundations or expensive chainlinks?

dont get trapped in local minima, its the meta game that really matters. its the orchestration

put analytics. check simple way

welcome to adams shitty blog

say that i respond to anyone reasonable, id love to hear what you think about anything ive said, dont be shy!

why im doing it shitty on purpose. ill clean later. procrastination history

talk about life story

talk about recent news with me like incorporating .townhall. trying tons of new physical games. internship ending and singapore plans

why am i writing a shitty blog. make that the title


talk about addiction
why it happens

women bear with existence, men must prove they should live

mimesis is fine as long as you think independently on what matters esp

power law shape

thought experiment
thot experiment
if you could hear a little voice in your head that tells you exactly the right choice to make in every decision, with all variables considered, would you always listen to it? the other version is if you didnt have free will but could only observe the perfect life

talk about power laws
whats the engineering plan and why

what are the paths before me, school, job, code media, lets see what happens at network state.

what comes easy to me is talking a lot and asking a lot of questions. too much for some. i need to talk online and meet people online to satisfy this need for expression

anime
make markdown better line spacing when translating to html

i can be super needy cringe awkward embarrising. but i know i am and i still am willing to be for what i want? what do i want? maslows extended.

distill essays after a while, then riff more from my own essays, on spotify and youtube? ai trained? it needs data

list more heuristics.

just focus on volume rn, dont edit, just post


i mean i wanna do like what elon did and get wealthy with code (permissionless leverage like naval says, along with media to build relationships at scale, like david senra pointed out), then i can work in the atom-tech thats foundational like energy gas manufacturing housing



talk about my favorite kpop idols

maybe when a blog post gets too long, i can break it up into subparts and link to each

talk about being from guam and its career challenges, maybe its a good constraint because i really focus on code and media because of it


talk about going to therapy, talking needs to be a compliment to action, not a substitute, from thiel's recent talk with joe rogan

what other leverage is there? besides code media capital labor?

put gpt on tools

show my monthly burn, what i pay for. talk about dave ramsey personal finance

how much should you share online? talk about the tribal 150 dunbar number example

color note by green yellow red, which essays are more polished than others. talk about that in the format. balance quantity and quality. but quality THROUGH quantity

with the gap year and being financially independent, i really learned the value of a dollar, from an emotional level lol.

make each title of post a directive

write about dating

write about porn addiction and how i solved it*

what am i afraid to write about?
the prostitute guma' uritao incident

why am i writing? whats the point of this? what if i say embarassing things? who am i writing to? does that matter? (rick rubin)

i dont NEED to work, i CHOOSE to be fired, or make choices. this reminds me of school, i get cash, and i have to be at a certain place at a certain time, but

make a "tools" blog post, show chrome extensions, and other tools like sortmymusic, playlist miner

1,1,so heres the money early game: write and code. then i can go for energy gas manufacturing. like elon, software first. and heres why: software and media are permissionless leverage, then i can get capital and labor for permissioned labor, but i can allocate and use my judgement. software has no marginal cost of replication, so as long as i provide value with my code or media, itll spread like wildfire (at least i hope so). an audience and a reputation is accountable skin in the game

shitty firsts gets you into the game, better than perfectionistic nothingness

add a pic for each blog post, should appear in blog list

maybe writing online in markdown aint a good idea idk:

Tips for Using Markdown
Headings: Use # for main titles and ## or ### for subheadings.
Lists: Use - or * for bullet points and 1. for numbered lists.
Emphasis: Use *italic* or **bold** for emphasis.
Links: Create hyperlinks with [link text](URL).
Images: Add images with ![alt text](image URL).

i can always transfer content to wherever else

find a better way for markdown formatting and line break stuff. pandoc should do better

you can tell a lot about someone by their music

talk about films i like

in blog: i just wanna share stuff with people, and if i dont have people that wanna hear what i wanna say, i feel ignored

thats a great pithy heuristic: if you want girls that you like to like you, live and level up so that YOU like YOU ~ noah kagan. great framing. do YOU like YOU?

the game theory optimal way for good prisoners dilemma relationships is bid for long term, if they fuck with you, fuck them over / have boundaries, then try again for the long term, train them. punish them if they deserve, but keep trying for the good

people build reputations for truth, but its not the person, its about the truth

my current life philosophy: death is a 1 way door, so lets see what we can do in this life. will to live, will to power, will to love.

unbundling college

not destroying the means of error-correction is the basis of morality - deutsch. so thats why free speech is actually a good vs evil kind of thing, its actually that important huh...

deutsch lowkey exemplar, also noah kagan. map out the connections between them all

knowledge and resources. like oil isnt a resource to a caveman, because they dont have the tech stack, talk about the tech chain

do they give you bad vibes? i mean thats a legit reason. i trust subconscious.

fav video games of mine: minecraft, terrario, black ops 2 zombies with the boys, fifa, overwatch, guitar hero/rock band great memories, tetris, hearthstone

why does it have such a bad rap? maybe because money is fungible power and short term bad actors can steal kill whatever for it. so ethical is long term? but there will be parasites and bad allocation, "adjustments" as euphamism\n\nexcellence through being prolific * high taste * bold sales.\n\ni like thiel because hes both a philosopher and a capitalist\n\nwhen a blog is done, wrap it up in a book, e book sell via stripe. also sell an mp3, with good tts.\n\n8vs johnathan bi, joe lonsdale, peter thiel, david perell, peterson, tyler cowen\n\nwhat is time to profitability for each project. upfront costs divided by profit\n\nyeah gatekeepers suck. thats where permissionless leverage comes in\n\nthe idiot index: getting cost down to the price of material constituants + IP price. and even then, there are ways to bring the supply of material constituatnts up\n\ncapitalism is an/THE engine of economic growth\n\nfiguring out if a project is economically feasible is fun to me. does it check out on paper?
