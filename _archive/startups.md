I see technology like a chain or stack

tech defined as "any better way of doing things

like imagine if you're a caveman, not many things are resources to you

david deutsch talks about transformations and knowledge, he's super relevant here

also. substance not time. let me explain...

if you were a caveman, and you had your tribe, and the goal was to, as fast as you could, replicate modern society in 2024, how would you go about doing it?

you couldn't just start building nuclear plants or whatever, you'd have to start with the constituant parts: metal etc

well how does a cavemman get metal? first they'd need to know where it's located, no?

ill finish this essay later lol its pretty deep with all the implications and rabbit holes i can go down

my plan is to go from Mongo to Gundo: meaning code and media, gain capital in a permissionless way, then place myself in a tech hub so i can work on energy gas and manufacturing (advanced and housing)

this housing thing ive been thinking of. its like do you work on the foundational layer of the stack (energy gas manufacturing) first? or do you work on the most expensive link in the value chain? (housing is a good target)

and regulation comes into play, which highlights the importance of the network state. and whats the bottleneck to actually seeing the first network state?

...

maybe the idea is good but not the right time, the cost curve of the expenses are too great for it to plug into the current markets. like cavemen wouldnt buy cryosleep, even though thats fuckin awesome.

...

startups dont have to be just bits of course, can and should be increasingly atoms-based, and also bio-based

...

if your business ideas suck and dont motivate you. remember that you can come up with more. over time

also remember that elon didnt start on zip2 till he was 24

business is the new war? lol

be authentic AND know what the best problems are. founder, product, market fit. the market is the people who have that problem, the product is the solution

entrepreneurship is just-in-time science

how would v1 companies you like look in your idea spreadsheet? is there something about the idea? upfront execution yes. value add


PMF is escape velocity


generations of founders, like jon yongfook, pieter levels goat

im a founder

build something people want, talk to users. clear goals, immediate feedback, challenge-skills balance, sustainable living

the right audience, not  a big audience. just like quality > quantity


the good thing is that i get my time back. the bad thing is no income lest i build my lever. media and code

build permissionless levers

blog, made, store, podcast

how do i productize myself, i can be low supply with combinatorics and combinations with venns, but its gotta be aligned with the great problems of our time. important and urgent

leverage on value


code and media transformations to capital and that to less stress, then to labor, and the code is also equity in. my own business, then gundo and energy gas manufacturing

life and entrepreneurship is problem solving

with every ai tool, theres an api cost. as long as CAC < CLV, youre cherry
