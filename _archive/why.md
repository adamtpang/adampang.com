why am I writing this blog?

I mean I learned from naval that code and media are permissionless leverage, so I'm doin it

this is part of the "media" side of things

later I'll be adding a digital store to cover the code side of things (indiehacking style)

this is kinda just like public notes, no biggie

...

i noticed how much i admired people who put themselves out there on the internet, so i wanna do the same [exemplars post](../exemplars)
(testing links in markdown)

...

i plan to just word-vomit a ton of posts, see what i like, remove what i dont, expand on what i like. this is for the long term

...

I could've posted all this on twitter but i don't like the idea of forcing my text on someone's feed if they don't ask for it, so I'll keep writing here on my blog and let it brew here, then point the good ones to people on twitter and other sources

...

i also plan to riff more on the top 20 of 100 tweets i did for my 100 tweet experiment.

im doing this to build relationships at scale, after hearing david senra say that.

i noticed how many of the people that i admire put themselves out there. lets see. holy shit actually all of them have either written a book, they tweet, or they write blogs, or they put out youtube videos or podcasts. literally all of my top teachers / online mentors

thats a good question: what is true among all the people you admire? the answer should be a good compass for yourself.

and not only people, the who, but what do you want for your life?

time will wash away a lot of things, but there are things that will exist beyond you.
