I love this website: https://www.statsforspotify.com/

it shows you your top songs on different timelines: 4 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months

it also shows you your top artists and genres

...

music is a great way to know someone, in an abstract / vibey way, so i like seeing other people's lists

its like spotify's yearly end review, but on demand, its great

...

check my "tools" blog post to check out other cool tools

...

according to the website, my top 9 artists are: (and ill share 2 great songs i think you should listen to)

don't hold me accountable for these lol:



1 aphex: avril 14th + xtal (super super pioneering electronic artist. no lyrics)

2 beatles: revolution + you've got to hide your love away (come on... its the beatles, you cant go wrong)

3 newjeans: attention + omg (4th gen kpop)

4 kanye: burn + slow jamz (his fav artist is next)

5 taylor swift: our song + you belong with me (her fav artist was before)

6 alvvays: pharmacist + adult diversion (like a surf indie rock vibe)

7 vampire weekend: campus + obvious bicycle (prep rock. formative band)

8 fleet foxes: third of may + wading in waist-high water (timeless folk-ish music)

9 stromae: fils de joie + sante (belgian artist with cool loops)

...

so weird how accents go away when you sing.

loud music thus cathartic, music is like a pattern of being. repitition with variation

i learned in music, after so long, that the lyrics dont matter much

damn, the beatles are like if you had 2 bob-dylan level songwriters in 1 coallition, and then a slumbering giant of george on top of it, with the vibes of ringo that matched the band. modern beatles ever? songwriter producer PLUS the actual artist/musician? and they werent just artists, they stood for movements, like muhammad ali

i dont get why the weeknd is #1 on spotify

what are the most popular artists on spotify FOR THEIR AGE. monthly listeners weighted against their age from band formation. also the same for forbes, who is richest per age of life (year)

global kpop meritocracy and ill be the philosopher tech ceo with music taste? a global jyp? that would be fun. i can be like the xg founder, but for an adore\n\njust a splice stack + ai visualizer is the seed of a whole ass song and mv. if i can do 100 of those with vocal effected lyrics... boom. permissionless body of work of music for fame, and then females comin to me\n\nmusicians should publicly show what songs theyve archived / what songs are possible to show up in setlist so fans arent dissappointed that their fav song wasnt played like me with 1975 and the city girls chocolate\n\ni want psychadelic tech music, like indiesong but with acoustic sounding synths and midi playing acoustic. i want midi playing guitars. learn from what luke farritor did with the minecraft floating guitar thing. follow him on ig\n\nset up discover weekly to just aggregate weekly into an inbox playlist. i want stats for spotify to use that vector embeddings clusters to make discover weeklys automatically with manual songs and ai splice ableton mcp sort of songs. the diff between midjourney and pinterest..\n\nemulate and cross pollinate the best artists that i like, when i make songs. also reach out to other people that i admire on a music level. a gorillaz style internet band with music. quantity and quality. see the analytics of where the fans are via spotify, then go deep on those areas and market geographically to them\n\nmake an X kpop onboarding guide thread. generations, kpop culture and language. the music shows, the shared universe. slang like bias, wrecker, etc. good examples of groups and songs from each gen. and good example groups like temp, superhuman, etc. timeless songs. fancy twice. do a soccer onboarding thread too? welcome to your new obsession.\n\nimagine fast, profilici, high quality music from a band. no touring, just media music leverage. output output output. creativity, experiments, themes, genre combos, ideas, all digital and shit. digital and analogue instruments, storytelling, ai help, albums logos, secretive game-like derek sivers liike, exploding kittens style kickstarter marketing. bro ill be a secretive 1 man band with hit after hit, a sliding window menu\n\ni think i need to release singles or something in my life, like on spotify, vocal effect, digital production, covering gems and my own originals. but about what? have ai help me. remember that lyrics dont matter focus on beat and production. idk about splice, gotta record guitars or something so wealth first. music art is permissionless leverage, i can make like a prada, i can leverage online resources for tips? idk. have vocal harmonies. digital plus classic 4 piece band\n\nmodular digital band. im the pillar and maybe miguel feature etc. someone else can play an instrument. maybe making songs in public sharing the files then ill publish. like how superorganism does it or how steely dan tried out guitar solos. i can have work in progress songs or revisions renovation songs and rereleasing in a diff style or a diff a part or bridge etc. modular production modular credits modular creative menu with archival etc. like an akb48 lol. modular mv makers like what i wanted for kpop: sports transfer model\n\n
