dave ramsey's baby steps is pretty good

debt fuckin sucks

i think theres actually a step 0 though


0 income

1 save 1000 (baby fund)

2 debt snowball: list debts smallest to largest, pay off smallest to largest (great psychologically)

3 save 3-6 months of expenses

i think steps 0-3 are most important

the rest of the steps are about saving up in investments, college funds, charity, etc.

4

5

6

7

...

if its health, wealth, wisdom, fun, its okay to spend. reminds me of ramit sethi's "money rules"

im paying 120 bucks in CC interest monthly this is ridiculous. i need to owe society QUICK!
as long as you spend less than you make, youre golden, youre wealthy

equity is a form of leverage. kinda the inverse of capital. you can start with 100% leverage

what was the


debt can be better than equity???

venture capital is lowkey the best charity. net positive for both

i want to earn just enough that its higher than my burn (+800$), but i really want time for code and media



the long game metters for compounding. be honest about what games you have endurance for

better to be chased for the money than having TO chase

what am i allowed to spend on:
books
food
rent
tools
business investments
exercise

what do i do when i get capital? capital allocation becomes important
labor?

hard work is not a sufficient variable for financial success

how does geo-arbitrage work? how you can earn in USD and buy tons in asia...

ill spend on needs, health, books, business investments

learn the first principles of the wealth game you can rederive the solution in a free market environment with some time

building wealth means that society owes you in a way, or you can catalyze society to work for you

leverage leverage leverage

im not wealthy yet but i wanna help people like me lol.

why do people not talk about money? to prevent envy or judgement? i really dont wanna spread luxury beliefs

sustainable wealth creation

leverage is like an exoskeleton. you start off with a human body, as you gain more and more leverage, its like you are in a transformer, you get bigger. your judgement suddenly becomes more important because you could do this or this, inaction and opportunity costs emerge

career science. what are the axiomatic fundamentals of building wealth

talking about naval's frameworks, we wanna get wealthy, but what to do?

list salient problems:
i want to move but
why?
flight and housing is expensive
i need more cash

my mongo to gundo plan

why do we want money? to pay bills, to travel. why? to live,

build where its most expensive: housing.
look at what you pay for, can you do it better?

build what you cant buy, buy what you cant build

list my monthly burn and talk about dave ramsey

show my monthly burn, what i pay for. talk about dave ramsey personal finance

with the gap year and being financially independent, i really learned the value of a dollar, from an emotional level lol.

to create wealth. own and be accountable for a leveraged solution to a good problem. relevance

talk about what i spend, dave ramsey baby steps 1-3 is most important, theres a hidden step 0: income

opportunity cost of money and time

just like if you have cash but dont know what to do with it / no plans, same for money. if you dont have a better way to spend your time, get a job.

does it have to be a balance? whats the optimal spread?

its okay to gamble if youre the house. how do you be the house?

should companies show gross then post tax salaries? where do the taxes get reallocated? how does it come back to you?



the big problems are cheap housing singapore and how to make money after singapore. im in debt, if im gonna work a job i better be learning something useful. maybe i can have a mixed approach where i apply to jobs online AND i work on my side things. do i work with people on guam? twitter? im not the best coder, but maybe i can be low supply high high demand (good positioning) through combinatorics.

economics is about being useful. building something that others cant, and they pay you. i feel like i have a good understanding of the building blocks of creating wealth. but i gotta code and write more.

my history with gatekeeprs and permissioned stuffs. hate it, gonna go side door, circumvent this shit. im getting leverage the permissionless way. the world will open up to me
