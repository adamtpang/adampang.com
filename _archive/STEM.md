Aspiring Sci-fi Engineer: Software + Hardware (materials/manufacturing + electronics ~ robotics). Exploring global maxima and power laws.

its a sad life. socially hanging on. i want more security. i gotta be a good friend

so are humans cold incentive-following creatures? including me, including you

i mean the slope is different from the y intercept

if someone has done it, you know from 1st principles its possible. but if no example, you gotta do the first principles calculus to be sure of the solution derivation

Aspiring Sci-fi Engineer: Software + Hardware (materials/manufacturing + electronics ~ robotics). Exploring global maxima and power laws.

Very interested in energy and manufacturing (foundational tech bottlenecks).

as a dropout, if i were to go to traditional college, what major would i pick? physics/math cant go wrong, but its pretty general. mechanical? nuclear? more specific, lots of physics and math overlap. focus on the best atom-problems first: energy gas manufacturing (advanced and housing)

doing makerspace hardware. learning 3d printing electronics mechatronics + software AI. hardware is hard holy shit, need a compelling mission like energy gas manufacturing (housing / defense) for real dopamine unlocks

OH MY FUCKING GOD: star farms (nuclear or solar), connect to sabatier machines and bitcoin mining rigs (sucks up all the volatility). i can do this on a smaller scale. what other star-farm-connectors / lego blocks can there be??????

human printing in the future? we could just print humans??? if it does not break the laws of physics

spec kno is understanding the landscape of variables and knowing which  you can manipulate

so i know software a fair bit, i eventually wanna learn hardware but its very capital intensive to learn. i mean i can apply for grants to run experiments, and maybe that can get me an internship. but i think with software, small value at scale means tons of capture value, but with hardware, i think you gotta work on advanced manufacturing thats super useful to people, so that you can get high value low supply (hard to make things)

solar powered solar panel manufacturing factory please

there are no rules except physics -musk and deutsch

i dont want to just talk, i wanna do stuff in tech. bringing value in tech to the masses. code and advanced manufacturing. energy gas manufacturing

find advanced manufacturing bootcamp?

life formulas/equations

talk about foundational tech like energy gas manufacturing

power law shape

talk about power laws
whats the engineering plan and why

as long as we got teams solving and maintaining each link in the tech chain, it unlocks new links, up and up the pyramid

how do we make atoms as scalable as bits?
the idiot index: getting the price as low as raw material constituants + IP. thats the in the limit lowest price. and even then, you could in some cases increase supply of the raw materials.

solving lifees equations

if physics and math are fundamentals of stem, music is fundamental to meaning/feeling, at that base level

make markdown spacing better w pandoc

oscillate between code and media. blog post a day, github commit a day on the relevant topic on the relevant project. the reason why this first before hardware is because its permissionless leverage. i mean i can learn hardware but i feel like id have to go to advanced manufacturing first since the scaling part is uber suck, like elon said. energy, gas, manufacturing houses like cover. but how do they differentiate.

batch git

knowledge and resources. like oil isnt a resource to a caveman, because they dont have the tech stack, talk about the tech chain

Really hard to get a tech job, so now new obsession - looking into physical engineering, looking at online certificates, talking to people [mom says he’s on the spectrum, she jokes about that]\n\nuse tech to no downside increase my height. i mean if you were a short guy wouldnt you increase your height with gene therapy? like restart your growth plates then hgh makes you grow, then fuse em back together. use natural ways to better yourself and tech ways. tamed nature comprehensive tech. to be technical is to be human\n\nacademies labs popups workbenches, we need decentralized nodes like this worldwide. maybe a laptop is all you need, laptops are grand charities. if you wanna increase stem and art, give people these workshops and shit, but how do you keep it profitable for these poor ass kids lol. how do you vett people how do you have trust\n\n1,1,the responsibility of founders is felt when IF the they dont build their thing all these bad things happen thats the mark of a painkiller tool. well ive also found that utility isnt THAT straightforward. i think that elons framework is good: utility delta of the state of the art * the amount of people it affects. das pretty good\n\nthe beauty of software is that its easily scalable, but with atoms its not, yet. thats why i focus on energy and manufacturing, because if we have energy too cheap to meter, and manufacturing at scale, with robotics and ai, atoms can be as scalable as code is. also transport and logistics and supply chains, thats transport, flexport, amazon.\n\ngood pro for "dontdie" imagine if your fav dead heroes and fav dead loved ones were still alive. dontdie (increasing healthspans of people) is good because humans do take a lot of ramp up time to start getting competent, so we can just increase the primes of our lives. it doesnt just have to be 20s 30s 40s etc. imagine when 50s 60s 70s are STILL a human's prime.\n\nMatter and what matters. Scapples. Abundant super cheap. Start low quantity high margin, end with high quantity low margins. Same product, abundant for all, basically out of nothing / more from less. Future of religion bahai + science and psychadelics. Practical clinical psychological advice. Learn from the academic, but apply it as much as you can. Follow the problems.\n\ncombinatorics of tech skills. not being #1 in software. but you suddenly become rare IF you combine software and hardware skills AND you need to make sure that those skills are useful to s tier missions, meaning teams that are working on solutions that solve major problems, AND you must own a piece of that solution, so you can earn non-linearly. clear thinking for the win!\n\ncoding should be a magic button of problem understanding action to go super fast from idea to market. 1 who am i serving 2 what change is sought? ideas fast, coding fast, marketing fast. generate curate elevate. make those moneys, nail it before scaling it, word of mouth will do the marketing, focus on building and making it better for users. and im a user so id know. seo takes care of itself\n\noscillate between code and media. blog post a day, github commit a day on the relevant topic on the relevant project. the reason why this first before hardware is because its permissionless leverage. i mean i can learn hardware but i feel like id have to go to advanced manufacturing first since the scaling part is uber suck, like elon said. energy, gas, manufacturing houses like cover. but how do they differentiate.\n\nso i know software a fair bit, i eventually wanna learn hardware but its very capital intensive to learn. i mean i can apply for grants to run experiments, and maybe that can get me an internship. but i think with software, small value at scale means tons of capture value, but with hardware, i think you gotta work on advanced manufacturing thats super useful to people, so that you can get high value low supply (hard to make things)\n\nwhy am i doing mechatronics? to combinatorics software electronics materials, but why? to point employers to my cool thing and get hired at terraform figure hadrian. and to show internet, to combinatorics the 3 skills, and sharing online is a 4th thing, with courage. and i can get grants, pocket the difference (good incentive for cheapness). tell medici 1517 grant i want to make my own autodidact curriculum for myself for the basics, also for sabatier / electrolysis. can i make my own home lab?\n\nSo what are the global maxima, s-tier problems? How would you even define it? Well, maybe to start, what are the salient problems in life? Maybe that energy, gas, housing, and food cost money and aren’t abundant, and therefore cheap. Things where the implications are enormous, or foundational, commodity-like innovations. After you specify the best problems to work on, and zero in on a few/one, ask yourself what are the best solutions and its constituent parts for its timeline. So for energy has solar, batteries nuclear. Gas has\n\nto john on discord: TL;DR: Elon’s schools (Ad Astra/Astra Nova) ditch grades, focus on problem-solving, first principles, and STEM-heavy projects, with no fluff—just real-world challenges. Kids learn at their own pace, often through hands-on “conundrums.” For Balaji’s Network School mini-school, adapt this by going digital-first, adding network state skills (crypto, governance), and using tech to scale while keeping it community-driven. Start small with a pilot: 10-15 kids, online, solving network-themed problems over a few weeks. https://grok.com/chat/363ed30d-847b-4de7-8cb7-333358c203a2\n\nbought a vr headset as a teen, bought a 3d printer, **\n\nprotein and lifting (find a way to lift now) = muscles\n\n8 then get coding and make updates and release the code\n\nthe best a government can do is reduce friction for stem\n\nresearch how to better brain health after the soccer hit\n\nmath underlies physics and cs. physics underlies math and cs\n\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/manual-add-purchase \\n\nyou can reject the question: new dimension on radar unlocked\n\nmake adampang the main repo and the other domains point to it\n\ngotta love universal explainers and universal constructors lol\n\n1,1,help ns generate figures like numeric dashboards and shit?\n\n5 then deploy to anchor marianas with the markdown to html thing\n\nwith software its usually low value but COLOSSAL SCALE potential\n\nlive as abstractly as is reasonable, towel of babel, python vs C.\n\nsoftware wont "die" as long as their are important things to build\n\ni like plastic bottles and cardboard as scrappy hardware materials\n\nai generation * human judgement is amazing. im so grateful for stem\n\nwrite about balaji's software first is the proper order of operations\n\ngitpush make sure railway vercel are good and then show mama progress\n\ni once conjectured pi and the famous geometric theorum: a^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nthe genetic stuff im blessed with is high iq and meta big 5 stats OCean\n\nlearn some C for learning purposes of deeply knowing how computers work\n\nmathematical analogies >>>: like gradient descent, vector sum, integrals\n\nlearn basic math and basic programming, these are the new modern languages\n\nbalaji is solving the losev problem (they can afford it through pure brain)\n\npi is the circumference of a circle in proportion to its radius or diameter\n\nyou can sorta quantify most things lol. i personally have come to love math\n\ngithub, mongo, react, node, vercel, railway, stripe, lemon squeezy, phantom\n\nlearning how to code is like learning how to read and write and basic math.\n\nsoftware before hardware the proper order of operations for a lot of reasons\n\nsaas experiments results. realizing dark unknowns through the light of time.\n\nerite down software companies that are successful today and put them on paper\n\nrename and parse ubuntu and windows projects. github save thhe important ones\n\nmath concepts to live by: vector sum, gradient descent. write this ebook idk.\n\nprogrammers have turned into and always have been, orchestrators of abstraction\n\nget dna test from nucleus, then try blood work for T levels and check lead or **\n\nlowkey glad i didnt get a tech job, i couldve been funneled in a bad local minima\n\nto program well, you need to think clearly and articulate well. courage speech vision\n\nwhen i see my slope getting higher than their y int, the student surpasses the master\n\ncode is the concrete the electricity of the internet the cloud continent the metaverse\n\nim solving math and decision trees till my goal: wealth through permissionless leverage\n\nSTEM curiosity religion dont die network state religion tribes and cults again incoming\n\ni only started liking math when it became relevant, and theres a lore thats fascinating\n\nget solar sabatier bitcoin rigs going?
