games and meta games. mainquests vs side quests. money romance body

i have a friend who was getting really obsessed with poker, cause he was losing (i get it, been there)

i had to remind him that poker is a minigame, in the meta-game that is life / consciousness / the universe (whatever lol)



music is my first love
then philosophy
then tech

hardship reveals dark capability

tell the story of my life?


noone is good at everything. even elon sucks at his family life i guess. you can take anyone successful on any dimension, and fine the dimensions that they suck in, or where theyre suffering. like elon is great at business, but stresses out a ton, hes overweight, even with the greatest people, its so fuckin easy to poke holes in their life. look in the mirror, how can you improve YOUR life?

many mistakes, but revivable and resilient. little mistakes, but destroyed when the flood comes









if you live as a Christian, youll get a Christian outcome\n\ncreat a body of work, undeniable. belief comes before ability\n\nsleep-exercise, time-life, ideation inventio discover notes, wealth monitoring\n\nit sounds culty, etc. but its like thomas in the bible, gotta see it and feel it to believe it..\n\nthe code is like me wrapping up the candy and packaging before school. the media is like me going around school asking if people wanna buy. if not thats cool, if they do thats cooler\n\n
