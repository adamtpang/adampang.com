Jesus is the ultimate scapegoat? because he didnt deserve it

modernity feels more pagan than Christian

christianity and johnathan bi

Christ exposed our sins. love thy neighbor, unconditionally. this is the message of dostoevsky as well. it only counts if it costs

i grew up in Christianity, after exploring other religions, i still like Christianity the most

do not look around to others, only up to God

every Westerner bathes in the waters of Christianity

i feel so conflicted. ive sinned, i dont think i believe in the dogma of christianity but im still so troubled by it. maybe i do need to go to therapy. but what happens when i exhaust all the times? i feel less empowered

Jesus is the ultimate scapegoat? because he didnt deserve it

should be a daily bible like daily stoic, accessible

as long as you reach the a-s tier, no need to worry about rank if you fall into the good bucket. do not look around to others, only look up to God
