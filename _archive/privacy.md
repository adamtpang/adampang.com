The visualization and indexing could inadvertently reveal sensitive connections or information they hadn't intended to share broadly. Data Security: There's an increased responsibility to secure this data, as it could include sensitive network information. A breach could have severe implications. Misuse of Data: There's potential for the data to be used in ways not initially intended or communicated to users, leading to trust issues. Algorithmic Bias: The metrics you choose to index could bias the visualization in ways that might not accurately represent a user's actual influence or network quality. Platform Compliance: X's API terms might still restrict how this data can be used, even if collected with consent. User Fatigue: With so many platforms asking for similar permissions, there might be fatigue or skepticism among users about granting access to their social networks.\n\n
