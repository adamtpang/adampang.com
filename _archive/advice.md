be agentic

80 20 speedrun

teach yourself

hell yeah or no.

deutschian agency

do what scares me.

boils down to time.

focus on pareto spike.

be true to your nature.

physical > digital games

energy emotions buttons.

right thing, right now

I am too hard on myself.

fate has brought me here.

the question > the answer.

memento mori, amor fati.

keep looking, don't settle

you only fail if you quit.

plan learn build show tell

life is a series of games.

do what you think is right.

generate, curate, excavate.

relax, for the same result.

founders, family, friends

seek transformative truths.

memento mori: remember death

when in disaster, bit by bit.

is this a 1-way or 2-way door?

choose long term > short term.

what if I slow down on purpose?

every problem is an opportunity.

practice the worst-case scenario

use levers for multiplied force.

Be excellent and invited to play.

never forget the Deutschian lens.

what is the minima 8020 solution?

be internet first: code and media.

will my deathbed self regret this?

Rough and tumble play with everyone.

I can be the parent that my kids need.

diligence and savings lead to freedom.

by dwelling, you miss the opportunity.

remember that only 1/5th of this matters.

what would this look like if it were easy?

everything is hard, what hard do you pick?

question delete optimize accelerate automate.

you cant be normal and expect abnormal outcomes

get back up 1 more time; death is a 1-way door.

the answer is the seeking, the spirit of it all.

who you will become must be rooted in who you are.

statistics does not work with a sample size of one.

validation from results from action from smallness

offer free work for proof of value to great people

you don't need to take life so seriously, laugh a little.

would I regret doing this at 100 years old / on my deathbed?

seek negative feedback, in the name of transformative truths.

every problem is an opportunity, the bad is next to the good.

the fastest way to get out of your head is to go into your body

even the most likeable people are hated, so its not a be-issue.

create your own "luck" (positive outcome from unknown source)

if there is doubt, there is no doubt.

amor fati (the love of one's fate). - this is my fate, i love it

I will be diligent in my calling, and I shall stand before kings.

constrain malevolence, confront chaos voluntarily, establish order.

learn the foundational knowledge to know which variables to change.

if you're not fucking up 20% of the time, you're not taking enough risk.

i'll figure it out, i'll make it work. if indulgences dont work, you must save yourself.

create surface area for luck. make your own luck. positive outcomes from unknown sources.

general adaptation to the meta-game, ecology of practices-species for life adaptation, non-extinction.

productize yourself w/ accountability for output not input + leverage. product * sales and own the solution to a great problem

I did not fail, I succeeded in proving that that way won't work. the beauty of tests and experiments. build and test

follow the highest conception, the answer is the seeking; the question IS the answer. do I have any better ideas on how to spend my time?

it will take time for substance to take place. life orchestration. let go of past mental maps if it does not work, create new maps as needed. practical solutions, not critique. what you are
seeking, is seeking you.

...

unsolicited random advice bits:

explore exploit. never try, never know
be considerate to the audience

dont get too caught up in the minigames, focus on the main quest, the meta game is the set of main quests

just learn, just solve problems

you can trust peoples opinions on inidividual review things: film, food, music, youtube, but not when its off mere opinion

i dont have to be well known but can be known well

just learn, follow curiosity. find the gaps in the world that you uniquely can create, leverage, and own

its a sad life. socially hanging on. i want more security. i gotta be a good friend

stand the test of time. perservere

for girls, are your looks a part of you?
for guys, is your money a part of you?

okay asking pretty girls out doesnt work. why? they dont trust me, theyre not attracted to me. why? because they know nothing about me, because there are no strong signals. so...

i like a clear clarity plan. clear goals, immediate feedback, challenge skills balance

stand the test of time, the serious people will still be here after years, if they have the endurace inheritly aligned with their nature

i like pragmatism. you wanna go there, but youre here, what do you do to get where you wanna go?

should we be able to change our name at 18 or something?

i learned what to be public about and what to be private about

scaling down the task so perfectionism is easy to beat. minimal good release

if youre cool, ill invite you into my life, and im working on bettering my life too

- list stressors, the big problems, for me to like me, to make my life better

talk about it AND be about it

yeah its pathetic. im a fucking human, i went to a prostitute, i wanted to have sex really badly. is that so fucking bad? its fucking pathetic, and sad yeah... but i fucking ask girls for their number (4 times), i got rejected 4 times, i work on myself, my health, my tech career, im not asking for pity, im just saying 100% ive been trying. ive been taking care of sleep diet exercise, hanging out, building a social circle. i fell into temptation like watching porn, i havent watched in like 3 years or something and im fucking proud of that. but to say that im not supposed to be sexual, thats fucked up, were fucking human, and the only reason were here talking is because our parents were sexual. IM FUCKING SEXUAL AND THATS OKAY. i go to therapy, i gotta talk about this, i gotta work on permissionless leverage. i like girls omg, and thats okay. i dont need to overcorrect for dad, i used to think being sexual was a sin or something, that rings true and makes sense on why i am how i am.

ive failed so much, been rejected so much, looked down on so much, but fuck that im going to rise and grow

as long as you work on your. highest conception, youll be fine

X respected person said that. heuristics break, unknowns are known to be inevitable, mistakes will be made. so what? so what do i/you/we do?

being self critical is sometimes good, but its a matter of why and when.

the long game metters for compounding. be honest about what games you have endurance for

make choices you can be proud of. make you like you first
what dont i like about myself?
short
hair
skin
in debt but getting better
need to do more code and media
saying no to say yes

just dont fuckin give up, learn

fearset shit: define prevent repair base hit inaction cost

if i like something and you dont, does it matter that much? i mean

i like brutal truths, feasability and what does xyz mean?

just do more with less

the fastest way to do something is to not do it at all

being short is a positive constraint

fortune cookies: use heuristics till they break

facing a mirror reaching in and hugging yourself

sometimes you can be rash though and give yourself unecessary ptsd lol

i stopped 3x speed and skipping songs. less impatience, more presentness? lol

feedback / truth is a gift

one good blog post or podcast is better than volume? well i see the merit in speed and volume too, just dont share embarassing stuff. safe stuff first

can i even find guys i like / wanna be friends with? THEN find girls i like. like attracts like, be and choose to be someone that YOU like

its gotta click in my mind

meritocracy is beautiful and cruel. leave the channels open

whats stressing me out? what am i greatful for?

you just need more wins per loss ratio

what do i have endurance for? learning? philsoophy?

hold on. dont rush. chill the fuck out. competition is for losers

buying my time back?
travel, friends, gf, location

openness: just follow curiosity
conscientiousness: elon algo

good people deserve good outcomes of course

all advice cancels to zero

you know youre being honest when its brutal

an encouraging word is heard for miles

dont quote, be considerate

i like long ranging thinkers, people that explore the idea maze, AND go through it

if its not relevant to you, drop it

can i soread out the stress for a more sustainable life?

simply, if happiness = reality - expectations, and my expectations are immense, then i gotta raise my reality fosho.

validation from results from action from clarity from articulation from

music sport sleep and progress are my therapy

sufficiently nuanced advice is indistinguishable from chaos

what am i not supposed to say? ill start within the overton window. alright... maybe ill keep creeping further and further out... mwahaha

when does honesty go wrong? if you cant get through the short term you cant get to the long term?

look at women's actions not their words. where do the girls that you like go? i like smart cute kind

make steps toward the life you want to live.

you can prioritize being low stress first. maybe working hard is lazy in a way, because if theres lack of clarity, youre compensating with "hard work" which is socially acceptable

how to guard against mimesis, examine your motivations. do not look around to others only up to God. well it begs the question what is God? well i think the vague point is more important than an explanation

hard work is not a sufficient variable for financial success

prime your mind like leaving a bucket out. you cant control the rain but when it comes, your bucket will

if it doesnt resonate then so be it

sometimes spreading yourself out with ADHD-like novelty builds motivation and connecting across domains, if it is true between A and B, its a deeper truth than either

what do i desire? is it my desire or anothers?

a lack of nuanced thought is a bad sign

scapple why am i doing xyz in life, and examine my life, be real about the reasons

why is attention seeking seen as bad? it feels shallow

learning is all about relevance

being the best does indeed have rewards, but also drawbacks. be authentic then? what if being authentic is not enough? what if someone is better than you on all fronts? what then? what do you do with your life?

what does what i talk about say more about me than you?

i feel permanently tainted by hiring a prostitute. its so sad. a 22 year old virgin thats 5'5.5 in height, in debt, living with mother, living out an oedipal complex, resentful. put the gun down?
are these problems solvable?
i cant go back in time, what can i do to right the wrong?

the question is the answer

become sharp so you can be powerful AND good

why are you listening to me? have i achieved what you are after?

but does it resonate?
but what does that mean for YOU?

to be able to render intelligible

the fastest way to get out of your head is to go into your body

did i want to be tainted? to NOT be innocent?

violence is blind

add some, remove some. or a lot

advice cancels to zero. its the tool you need at the right time, and youre a unique person different from others

i would be different with power and so would you, no? i guess well only know with a test

what is courage?
should i hide what i say?
should i say what i think?
should i embarass myself on purpose?

violence is blind

learn from people you hate / biased against. can i learn from a college educated person. its a challenge

well how else am i going to live?

money reduces # of sad days, but wont INCREASE # of happy days. meaning > happiness

it is through the testing that you will find your own unique path

if youre a nerd getting cought up in society and not prepared, dont kill yourself like aaron swartz

could this bite me in the butt? does this create anxiety sharing? is this evergreen? just archive and gitignore, dont delete

if there is doubt there is no doubt, get rid get rid

curate and remove doubtful posts to reduce anxiety. be strategic in what i share. i can always share again

remove bad indiehack ideas i wouldnt use

think about the long game

traits i admire in others: not take themselves so seriously, love noah kagan and tim ferriss about that. self-deprecation sometimes idk

as long as you disagree with parts of your heroes, you know youre safe from mimetic downsides

if you want to see who rules over you, see who you cant criticize, like parents

why am i doing this? the unexamined life is not worth living

how will you allocate your time, money, stress, dopamine?

what do you do when even in a platonic ideal, theres no consensus?

i like the bryan johnson way, like just follow the data. if the means gives better data outcomes, then sure, do that, but if not, ill stick to this

noone can insult me better than me lol, i know my lowest points

validation from results from action from smallness

if youre not willing to risk embarassment and mistake, then youll never know if you could do that thing you wanna do, be that person you wanna be, no?

so many single guys struggling, like me

i love being honest, but i wont share secrets unless i forget. the truth will set us all free. truth can be ugly

you dont need to write down self-reminding tasks: brush teeth, do laundry, wash dishes

as long as i progress on the important life dimensions i prioritize, i can take a lot more bullshit life throws me. but if im stagnating, i feel like shit and the bullshit hurts way way more. get the fundamentals right

anxiety and voluntary approach. doing what scares you. dont do unnecessary stuffs but when something you know you gotta do, and can do, do it.

strong and good

how much SHOULD you share online

i wanted to see if they would still love me even with my worst act

seperate doubts from surefire posts. i can always add back

go as fast as you can, in a way you can do for a long time. prep for the marathon, sprint when you can

before you compete, do you even want the prize on offer? look at worst downside best upside. thats the risk spread in a way idk

smart people think far range, long range. can see the good and bad before them

for what would i be willing to die for today?

doing only what you want is being authentic and will guide you to whats play to you, work for others, or just a fun thing. youll know

good general advice. not "things i tell myself" do what would make YOU like YOU.

to a sensitive person, theres so much thats fuckin salient, for better or worse. like blackbeard, double power, double pain

never ship, never know

the more i admire someone, the more ill put up with shitty tweets lol

talk about important topics even if its embarassing or scary to.

this isnt a hardship contest. thiel.

only ask of people what youd do OR if they actually like to do it

be tru to yourself

all advice cancels to zero, this is the invisible calculus. advice cancels to zero, but wealth can be positive sum of course, we do more with less, lest were still cavemen

only read the book if the compressions dont get the gist across. unless its entertaining to you of course

learnn from each rep

have at least 3 kids for the replacement rate

steelman both sides

what else?
physical?

i dont like people who play status games. is that just because im low status, and me saying that is a status move? damn im fucked lol

if your idea is already built, thats a good thing, the world has that thing. keep looking out for new good problems to solve. up and up the tech stack!

im disciplined diligent sorta lazy, and disciplined.

this isnt a hardship contest lol. pain still sucks no matter who experiences it. eustress is good, not involuntrary distress

leverage is like with greater power comes greater responsibility

just do 1 step. make the goals clear, immediate feedback (pat pat), challenge skills balance. do it the easy way, but go long on this path, be durable and endure. spread the stress over time

if an ADHD tries to focus on 1 thing that they dont want to, they get 3/10 done. if they just do what they want, including sometimes that task, it'll be at least 5/10 done. it's the variety that catalyzes momentum/motivation

endurance / durability are top rate traits

the more authentic you are to you, the less competition

keep searching, when you find it, youll know. youll fuckin know

to make it better make and remake

after a while, people repeat the same things.

if i feel shitty, what do i want?

whats the simple elegant solution?

work hard only if you got to. working hard costs more energy and stress and time, its all about allocation to the invisible calculus

what im afraid to write about?
what are my insecurities?

i can always talk to em again

i prefer diligent, smart, wise work > hard work

share my routine

im not wealthy yet but i wanna help people like me lol.

just have fun

do it at speed volume cheap relevant. what i want to do.

being wrong is a good thing. better to know truth always, even if it costs you, because its an ROI in long term truth

just do it shittily, ask questions, be relevant, dont prep just talk.

the most contrarian thing of all is to think for yourself, not oppose the crowd

leverage value first, then capture some of the value. be useful is a good heuristic

just being myself, always trying to improve. never giving up. smart not hard. being courageous

i wanna be systematic with my life. the unexamined life is not worth living so they say...

trim the chapters. like rick rubin, do it for me, listen to noone else? i mean trust yourself, and your ignorance...

podcast as therapy alternative? lol

what does your inner critic say? if you can provide counter examples youre good, if not, you got hw

i guess for tmi im only saying online what id say to a stranger?

if you can ignore the solution, it wasnt a big problem

if you dont believe in it, dont do it

small experiments. just see if x will work, have a backup plan. fearset shit.

it has to click for me

which is the better problem to solve for fellow humans?

what is a mistake anyway? falling short of a goal because of lack of knowledge or skill, both of which can be bettered

solve a good problem, then try to get time again. output should be time disconnected, just judgement

balance learning and doing

am i divergent because i just am or did i choose to, i wanted to be different? different doesnt mean good or bad it just means different. i deviate sometimes by nature, sometimes by choice

you can trust peoples opinions on inidividual review things: film, food, music, youtube, but not when its off mere opinion

if you give girls weird feelings or NOT give them attractive feelings, they wont be with you...

build the lever to then pull

stand the test of time. perservere

its a sad life. socially hanging on. i want more security. i gotta be a good friend

just learn, follow curiosity. find the gaps in the world that you uniquely can create, leverage, and own

i dont have to be well known but can be known well

for guys, is your money a part of you?

you can have your face online, just dont push it. like sia idk

talk about it AND be about it

should we be able to change our name at 18 or something?

X respected person said that. heuristics break, unknowns are known to be inevitable, mistakes will be made. so what? so what do i/you/we do?

do less

the long game metters for compounding. be honest about what games you have endurance for

substance not time, principles


make choices you can be proud of. make you like you first

talk about fun facts or quirks, like every time i do something im proud of i pat myself twice

critique my heroes
even in the people who i like, i can easily find things i dont like. so it makes sense why we dont like ourselves too. things to work on

therapy

wanting people to like me

talking or learning without action is cowardice

clear conscience priceless

if not this, then what?

the goal is input and output DISCONNECTED. use leverage so your judgement is the real factor. smarts * wisdom

why is your only reference other people whove done xyz, you gotta think 1st principles and derive Godly solutions to Devilish problems

if i can ignore the solution, its not a problem

where to live, not where do you live

sometimes, thinking doesnt lead you to the answer. bottom 3Ps

this is my fate, i love it

been going to therapy, every 1 to 2 weeks. i really like it. i need more people to talk to, so im just gonna blog lol

list salient problems:
i want to move but
why?
flight and housing is expensive
i need more cash

hypothesize solutions



saying no can be so hard but its a skill to build, no?

through volume and taste, you will become less shit. i just wont give up


i dont ask for money, ask for advice. only ask for money when accelerating. when you've exhausted all no-money experiments for what youre trying to do.

does this drain me or energize me? your subconscious might know. even if something is hard, if it energizes me, go do that

who are your mentors' mentors? top 2



for every



do what scares you. i need to make it to the states. code media energy gas manufacturing

make sure each title makes ME want to click

aim so that YOU LIKE YOU. then people like you will like you. make a great advice post, thats general and uncommon

talk about procrastination

build things thatd be valuable to you, and as you expand, the list of things thatd be valuable to you EXPANDS

what is salient? is a great question to just map out what's going on with your life

why do we want money? to pay bills, to travel. why? to live,

fulfill social commitments: JR and aydin gokce, then meta commitments from keeps

unfinished projects are like unfinished books. its okay. just return to it when you need to. you dont HAVE to force discipline and all that. i like discipline and diligence over the long haul, project management and cooperating with your past present and future selves, over time, with different frames and frame breaks, when discipline makes sense, youll know deep down

if you can ignore the solution, it wasnt a real problem

challenge skills balance:


dont do what you dont want to. if its clearly a good decision, fully aligned, its just courage you need, nothing more.



marc lou: never ship, never know

if you dont wanna do it, dont do it. do something else in the same vein

i feel so fuckin miserable. why? money, no concrete plan after singapore. more debt, no girlfriend, little friends. so what?

be useful

why is feelings non-masculine? im lowkey more sensitive than my sisters, what am i supposed to do? maybe the fact that im asking the question is not masculine. why do i care about being masculine? insecurity, i want a girlfriend, but first I gotta like me. do the things so that I like I

talk is cheap, actions and reality stress test your thoughts. experiment, fearset

validation from results from action from smallness

how open should i be?

i feel like a kid: why? im short (5'5.5) im living with my mom, im sometimes needy, i havent succeeded with money, i have little real good friends (arguably 1). i need to improve. money muscles calmness

take moonshots and regular shots.


how open should i be on internet. imagine a tribe podium dunbars number. what am i risking and for what

mental frameworks must be stresstested against reality

volume and voluntary approach destigmatize

commitments weigh heavy on me

i can be super needy cringe awkward embarrising. but i know i am and i still am willing to be for what i want? what do i want? maslows extended.

give awesome resources to learn certain things. cheatsheets

how to solve perfectionism: logotherapy frankl’s paradoxical intention. do it badly on purpose. the on purpose part is crucial, you cant fail if youre failing on purpose.

list more heuristics.


talk about going to therapy, talking needs to be a compliment to action, not a substitute, from thiel's recent talk with joe rogan

how much should you share online? talk about the tribal 150 dunbar number example

with the gap year and being financially independent, i really learned the value of a dollar, from an emotional level lol.

shitty firsts gets you into the game, better than perfectionistic nothingness

good frameworks i learnd

share my routine

common mantras to self

you can get to good answers by saying no to bad, and whatever youre left with. you can also say yes to things you think are good. generate curate excavate,

immediate relevance is great for flow

list what ive learned from each exemplar, some are so embedded

with any creation like code or media, make it super easy to do, for yourself. simplify

if people are jumping off the cliff, but theres good reason to think that theres actually something better off the cliff, ill look off the cliff, and when i see it, ill jump. when the math maths out...

i read the thumbnail, not the text kinda

talk about the shark+fish analogy. when people are crazier, more famous, they basically create room for you to be just less crazy, famous, wihtout being the first target for scapegoating.

when the student is ready, the master appears

love is free to give.

if you didnt like me then, then say no, unless i genuinely like them

when i gots money, travel and shit??? live and level up so I like me

if win-wins sound too transactional? whats the better option? mark manson and danielle strachman kinda insinuate that you dont want transational? well i hangout with X person because i like them (you GET something from them...?)


thats a great pithy heuristic: if you want girls that you like to like you, live and level up so that YOU like YOU ~ noah kagan. great framing. do YOU like YOU?

do they give you bad vibes? i mean thats a legit reason. i trust subconscious.

talk about time urgency, birthday anxiety? substance not time, super high standards

if i feel theres too much noise, publish 1, delete 2. if not enough signal, publish 2, delete 1. nah

just dont do what you dont want to do. who are you? and what do you want?

talk about avoiding things that i should do vs my whole self is aligned with it.
whenever i drop a commitment, i feel like telling everyone who knew. i want to be seen as someone who follows through??? yeah of course. dont say what i wont do

show my routine

what do i do thats actually my own? or do i copy everything? can i find examples of people doing what ive chosen?

sometimes its simply a lack of procedural knowledge

find the real value in the hype, destroy the idea as much as you can, and if it stands, you can trust

as long as the ball is not in your court, you have nothing to stress about, in regards to what you control

you need thinking and action, but one does not substitute for the othher

when you steelman, often you can see both sides, then nuance comes into play

insider outsider. has to be good to the smarts and the dumbs

the question is where do we go from here?

does it have to be a balance? whats the optimal spread?

curation is where choice is easier


i like when i get super into something, life breaks my frame, then i see it was foolish or thats not where i should focus/allocate attention

give me the cheatsheet

durabily good

Pain threshold?\n\ntry to see where people are coming from, step back and help them where they got lost, and youll get helped too when youve got things wrong. a good person helps his fellow man get back on the horse and back on the right path. deep down we know right? at least wrestle with the important questions\n\non anchormarianas, put a tip part optional where they can put more cash for what theyre buying. comparrow showing proof of work, and that ill have more ideas like this, and products released to their emails. sign up for product releases/updates, and my blog? adampalm. why im using a half-pseudonym\n\nshould i start a podcast? about what though? deep dives on interesting things to me? sabatier, elon, naval, balaji, etc. football. im down. i can just ramble by myself and a mic, for an hour, with my laptop near me, then descript can edit it i guess. spotify? youtube? and make clips for ig and x too\n\nmaybe i dont do the bootcamp.. i can always do it the next month, i dont understand first. i want to understand before acting.. i want to solve debt and lovelessness. i want to understand the problems.. is this a pussy move? or is it sage? talk to people i respect about this.. i want to make money but..\n\nwhen a problem is solved, that class of problems is permanently solved, this is the value of sharing ideas, just like in capitalism if you solve your problem, SELL IT so others have it too and we can stand on each others shoulders, and not repeat the same mistakes. THIS IS WHY WE SHARE IDEAS AND PRODUCTS\n\nfollow some people back on ig and x and farcaster? idk. if i dont follow anyone then its not personal, its a policy haha. check ferriss on this. i like learning from others cause they have fragments of the map, at least some have relevant parts of the map in their heads on Jun 11, 2025 at 7:30 AM - 8:00 AM\n\nif you dont know what to build, learn learn learn. follow your taste, specify what you want out of life, be very careful with your desires. its a contract with yourself to be unhappy until you achieve it, if ever. delete lesser desires, make room for the hell yeahs of life to get heaven. hell yeahs till heaven\n\nshare my cursor for essays, make this and post on essay thread. share more projects on a thread of projects.. under 1 name or make a diff account? i dont like muddying the waters but idk. i like topic-siloed consideration.. make this for farcaster: partial follows and unfollows, and tagged posting, vs general..\n\nthings that are obvious to you, may really be amazing to others, and vice versa. to messi, knowing what to do in each moment on the pitch is intuitive natural obvious, to him. same for von neumman, deutsch, these ideas, these ways of being, are obvious to them. share what you know, it may really help someone else\n\nask claude: im in a point where i wanna correct existing errors before making new ones. finish whats on my plate before adding more to the plate. i also want to figure out which day would be best to do my heroic dose mushroom trip, i want to do it right, help me with a checklist on Jun 12, 2025 at 5:00 AM - 5:30 AM\n\nsometimes the title of a book is the gist. i like the startup of you framing. the idea maze of your life applies to you just as much as startups. you can think long range about dots and scenarios ahead of you along the vector of your goals and metagoal, and when you encounter it, you arent blindsided and youre ready\n\nmake a twitter cheatsheet guide, have good reply game, post according to these rules and filtering questions. these are just guidelines, take in what you like, ignore what you dont like. repost what you wish youd have said. take notes in private. use "from:username keyword" in search bar to find what you want. etc etc\n\nput feedback? with an email address on all reddit posts and on each site. cal meetings with each of the customers. etc. how do i understand this problem from first principles? what is the problem? debt, need successful code product, ok so what? solve a problem for me, then share, ok i did, but no sales, why? grok soundboard\n\ncareer advice: solve problems, be so good they cant ignore you. focus on permissionless leverage, then transition to more and more leverage (permissioned or not). own leverage. create value capture value. leave a trail of solutions, be a giant that others stand on in the future, seep into the background of history in a positive light\n\ncold approach with women is like cold approaching a guy friend, you know how rare cool guy friends are? thats like a cool girlfriend, its THAT specific to you and both people need to resonate with each other. i havent even found amazing amazing s tier guy friends, maybe A or B, but not the no-brainer types. BE a no-brainer for someone\n\nmake diff twitter accounts for diff topics? same for newsletter. i dont want to mess up peoples feeds if off topic. the beauty of blogs is the person comes to you, with a twitter follow, they have to see everything you post even if its not relevant. i wanna be considerate. adam palm adam spruce adam birch adam oak etc? adamtree meta lol\n\nto get good at anything do it 1 10 100 1000 10000 times. diminishing returns but generate curate elevate in your chosen game. choose your desires and games wisely. what is wisdom? long term good decisions based on sourced principles and explanations. conjecture and test? but thats not enough? constant criticism and hammer-philosophizing?\n\nwrite about how to live a good life? asking the question. a non-suicide vow i made to a friend, so if were gonna live this life, how should we best live it? maslows? and how i wanna make life like a game. make writing also accessible like derek sivers. make money, time, kids, art, friends, experiences. what do u spend ur precious youth on?\n\nidk if commitments and goals are good. write about em. but why would people care about my opinion? they dont have to, just write, just code, just market on reddit and seo. teach people and include your thing. educate the market, give free value first. write about the ethics of opt in. noone is forcing you to do anything. including yourself\n\nwhat do people pay people for? for knowledge they dont know, dont have the time and unique suitedness to learn for themselves. i wouldnt pay for water if i knew how to get it. i paid for a dentist, airalo, etc. but what can i provide? im following my nose diligently first. im treating this like college, prioritizing learning and sanity haha\n\nwhat do people pay people for? for knowledge they dont know, dont have the time and unique suitedness to learn for themselves. i wouldnt pay for water if i knew how to get it. i paid for a dentist, airalo, etc. but what can i provide? im following my nose diligently first. im treating this like college, prioritizing learning and sanity haha\n\nhow do i solve my top problems, make an idea ma3 that is plausible to the light at the end of the tunnel, pragmatic idealogue shit. map it out. step by step. from current position measurement, problem awareness, flow game via explanations and experiments, and viable path out of idea maze to escape the maze escape the game till death do i part\n\nproject selection clarity. hard to vary explanations and risky narrow predictions (projects), its okay to put projects on the shelf, maybe its not the right time. what matters most is that youre doing your creative best, whatever that is. you literally cant do more than your best lol, and youll know.. what matters is the net, in the long term..\n\nwhat i learrned from 4 girl rejections. i got 1s number. its like sales oof lol. i have standards, ignore, let her initiate initiation. be visibly competent. before visibility you gotta be competent, so level up: wealth maybe, so permissionless leverage. i have an explanatory plan to get to my goals. what are my values my vector my strategy my goals\n\nYou dont have to be the best at everything. Play your own game, your own life. Know what is enough. Get to the finish line for whatever you need to. The other runners dont affect you, you can still help them too. If you want. Idk what is right to do. Probably to radiate outward, but begin with yourself first, and be selective with who “deserves help”?\n\noh yeah. post about the lky “if i had to make a living being an artist, id starve” so “know thyself” balaji gave me the campus design thing but its not working out. im not a 3d artist, or rather ive barely dabbled in it. if he asked me to write a blog or write a song or make an app, thats hella doable. if i asked him to write a song it wouldnt be the same\n\npost sivers’ if its not a hit switch, with the astounding products thing. if i know this can be big, then keep pushing. allocate in proportion to conviction remember. what if steve jobs overfocused on blueboxes. thread in the do not oversolve your problems. also post what if elon was overfocused on blastar. dont hold 1 thing too tightly. the light touch is the right touch\n\npeople usually cast a wide net to find the few good ones, but actually if you go where the good ones go, you can cast a small net and still get the desired effect. minimum effective problem solving to solve debt. minimum effective fame / visible competence to solve lovelessness. also need charisma etc check orion, zero effort, just like dan.. lol. i mean non-neediness yeah.\n\nnoone is good at everything. even elon sucks at his family life i guess. you can take anyone successful on any dimension, and fine the dimensions that they suck in, or where theyre suffering. like elon is great at business, but stresses out a ton, hes overweight, even with the greatest people, its so fuckin easy to poke holes in their life. look in the mirror, how can you improve YOUR life?\n\ni think on some level "what do i want?" is a poor question, a better reframing is what problem do i want to solve. instead of looking for gaining positive, you could look for subtracting negatives (i call: subtracting the subtractor). there are many reasons for this but one is: pain has a 2x multiplier than pleasure's 1x multiplier, so by reducing pain/problems, you are already more leveraged.\n\ndont appeal to authority. speak your mind. go back to visa and say define successful. its often nebulous. thread in create curate elevate. you clearly are a prolific creator, so why not curate? to solve your book writing problem. you can always go back to the longer version, but like rick rubin says, just try it, THEN decide if you dont wanna go down that path. but dont knock it till you try it.\n\nthe big problems are cheap housing singapore and how to make money after singapore. im in debt, if im gonna work a job i better be learning something useful. maybe i can have a mixed approach where i apply to jobs online AND i work on my side things. do i work with people on guam? twitter? im not the best coder, but maybe i can be low supply high high demand (good positioning) through combinatorics.\n\nits so cliche but maybe you wanna learn from others mistakes and experiments, but if theres noone to guide you, make your own experiments. obviously success is better than failure, but if you fail, dont waste it, learn from it, let it inform your worldview, i disagree with thiel. yes failure is a tragedy, but it is contact w reality, its truth of some kind, you can salvage it to inform your worldview.\n\nneed capacity for kids, show it, and find a girlfriend, then have like 3+ kids, AND dont die and vitalia shit. put an ns node wherever it makes sense, its like ingredients of a template with cash flow as the blood floe. where is the next node? and maybe we also connect existing and new nodes based on shared agreements / criteria. the school is to cement the education of the concept. understand dont memorize\n\non reddit, ask for feedback on a project that helps solve a relevant problem to that community. tell a story about yourself with the problem and how it helps others. hopefully it helps you but please tell me how it can be improved. minimal in this case was a mistake because its too linky and spammy. but rebuild and relaunch. keep going. be gritty and diligent. keep trying. not hard work but diligent smart work\n\nevery restaurant should have an online menu, a clear list of what it is price and picture. make a simple platform for them to upload to? sell a company if the project isnt top of mind and isnt creating as much value as you want, like golden handcuffs. free up your responsibilites and time and attention. clean life budgetting. meaning making as a subject. know that some things you wont find the answer to with words\n\nmy airchat: I would say to look at where you are, look at what you want slash where do you want to be, question why you want what you want, and once you're really sure about a direction you want to go, try and figure out a plan that's actually feasible, something that clicks in your mind like hey yeah that could work, and then break up the plan into little steps and keep going. I don't know what else to say, that seems pretty good.\n\nevery event or product starts with: are you *insert person with problem*? come to *insert offered solution event or product*. bad sleep? i can also target outreach to people in the whoop community with bad sleep and give em the tldr + credible results (show my leaderboard + weekly score + hours of sleep. and tell a story, we nailed the exercise, we nailed the diet, lets nail the last of the big 3 health trifecta. healthy wealthy wise.\n\nhealthy wealthy wise. lets discuss ideas, and lets act on them. what are ways were messing up our health, i can invite people to talk to the community and stuff. we can just figure it out, be omnipresent, TRY. healthy: kohlin, wealthy: pete oficiar / jonulloa, wise: books / share resources and stuff. every sunday. apex is literally healthy wealthy wise. kling is health, wealthy is blake, wise is jesse. it reminds me of arcane the armor collector.\n\nemail sivers. hey i noticed in your latest pod with tim that you didnt like elon. just like how you had prejudice against dubai... i feel like elon is lowkey your dubai in a person. if youre looking for flaws, youll find them. but these people are so polarizing you cant ignore em. look into him more, i think elon is more up your alley than you might know. obviously if youre actually interested to learn more about him *insert cool things* on Feb 5, 2025 at 1:00 PM - 1:30 PM\n\ni just want you dad to consider all the ways this project can go wrong, and if you have a rock solid answer for every point by all means go ahead and lets minimize risk and get 1 unit and prove out the concept, because once you can show success and major growing output for 3 months or so lets 10x the project and reap economies of scale and shit: put the containers in a warehouse, buy our own container truck and shit, and if you show success, investors will have WAYYYY more open pockets\n\n- frame the problem well, break it down, baby steps - satisfice: just do what's "good enough", get it to "good enough" - how to stop the perfectionist cycle: focus on you, be clear about what you want. stop feeling guilty for not helping others. to actually help others, help yourself. - what's fun today? - learn why the salient problem happens, and solve it. follow the fun? - be present in this moment, if youre going to die, then live at least - what if i cultivate boredom on purpose, for more creativity?\n\nhow do i sleep longer? too cold? need weighted blanket? need no debt and a girlfriend and friends? twitter for friends too. im mind isolated irl. so NSs for url to irl. build a startup to help that mission, i need money rn, i dont wanna trade time for money w bounties. be proud of what you say no to just as much as yeses, like poker. great fold great bet, and the right betting size based on the agent arena fittedness. does this matter? is this true? how do i know? pod about philosophy but follow salience, anderson todd side character see if the pod guests are aligned on topic\n\nif you had a magic wand, what would you change? if you could escape to another world? i would remove my debt, i would get 1 million in savings diversified, id get a girlfriend harem. id finish ns and copy paste it all over the world. id help others and finish my say-do ratio. id repair my social relationships, id do shrooms and get insight wisdom and be at peace. id wanna have a calm mind fit body house full of love. problems are solvable but what is the problem? im flailing here. i dont like being seen to be in a disaster. i dont like being seen doing poorly. so what? build something great and the network will emerge. 100 apps 100 essays 100 songs. create curate create curate.\n\nbanks need more apis. maybe girls can filter by money too. guys need to be more stoic locused, girls need to know that every condition adds combinatoric rarity and maybe mr perfect doesnt exist. show which dials to adjust and which expectations to manage to find someone whos 90% what you want. and know that perfection is a fool’s errand. and if you want height, also know that raising a kid well will make them taller than the parentd usually. bring up graphs. as long as taller than you. give 8020 advice to both sides. tell guys to get off the apps if theyre not lvled up to their satisfaction. lol imma make a dating app? first a dont be on this app till this this this. check orion taraban, sexton, alex grace checklist.\n\nbaby steps.

to me thats visa and naval\n\nlow cost is a GOOD thing, means its a buyers market. high cost is a GOOD thing, means its a sellers market. find your buyer and seller market in life, just like its good to be both a teacher and a student\n\nmaybe have 2 guests on pod so theres more to talk about and between all 3 of us. whats the name of the pod? put on spotify and youtube. under what name? stage name? adam p something. also get that domain name\n\none of the constants is change lol. there are timeless things. learn those first. naval is so fuckin right. hes go great stats. like my life starting 5 exemplars show where i wanna go, what i desire and admire\n\nadulting" is encountering real problems and being thrown in the deep end and you just gotta figure it out lol. id say seek to understand, the way becomes clear, then its just a matter of time and judgement etc\n\nmaybe the headline (super big) on every startup site REALLY does matter. it conveys 80% of WHY the user should continue looking at your site and buy your thing. so for hower: "For those overwhelmed by todolists"\n\nidk if its about surrounding yourself with people "smarter" than you, i mean what if you were talking to kid einstein, hes GONNA be "smarter" than you, but youre more knowledgable than he is rn. put a pin in this...\n\neven the best books have 1 star reviews, its a fools errand to try to make everyone like you, its impossible because of variance. youre always going to make a mistake, everyone makes mistakes, everybody has those days\n\nas i learned more and more truth, or became less wrong rather. i more and more ignore peoples advice, even those who i used to heed their advice. advice can be dangerous of course, *insert advice in proportion to admiration*\n\npost well and practice good reply game. esp post the things that repeat. compressed truths and directives, and things that ive been thinking about for a while and cant break. or funny things or fun things or good ass questions\n\nfind who my heroes heroes are, or what are the critical books or ideas that have 8020 positively changed their mental scaffolding of explanations or values. can you point me in the directions, the ways you see most positively?\n\ncreate an ideasbugs thing on every bottom right corner of every product txitter is an opt-in global group chat i help those who help themselves timeless, standalone, dont be afraid, dont stay in a lane i want a glowing young woman\n\njust because you have A girlfriend doesnt mean its a good relationship. i got super high standards for my self and who ill be with. i need to manage relationship expectations. no one person will satisfy all my needs as a human lol\n\ntentative cheatsheet to twitter to wealth creation to friendship creation. maybe dont post about sexual game until im in a position of success idk. will i ever post vulnerable stuff about prostitution and 4 horsewomen rejecting me? idk\n\ninterviewing the best is really useful, it sucks that its an opportunity cost for them but maybe it also untangles for them, its dialogos. but other than that it also brings the up and comers up to speed more, so you can make more elons etc\n\noften you can get the gist from the book's title. only read as much as you must. reading for reading's sake (unless you enjoy it) isn't necessarily a virtue. again (unless you enjoy it) there are tons of voracious readers who dont amount to much.\n\nlearn from the mistakes of those ahead of you. save time, make space for new better mistakes. uhh learn from other lives and you lived other lives. you can speedrun parts of other peoples lives, become a mosaic of your liking, a frankenstein's angel\n\nhealth wealth and wisdom positively permeate through your whole life. these are pareto-influential pillars of the life i want at least. i converged on these great desires. what else besides these? i think all 3 are great lol. they seem pretty all-encompassing\n\nwhen you have a kid you can make life better for them better than how you had it, based on how you lacked. like ill be a present dad for my son all the way even when hes an adult or whatever. they say a dad has to die though before a man can be a man ifk about that. .\n\nblog with scapple too. like a slideshow, show pics tastefully. also i dont need pics for all of my blogs. use tastefully. the less the better. dont break up the topic until its too long and it makes sense. when its clear theres a division or the posts deserve a second\n\nlearn from the best and get up to speed. trust your taste and judgement. be open to being wrong, being wrong is a good thing insofar as you find the unifying theory that resolves your previous theory conflict (problems). every evil is from a lack of knowledge, understanding.\n\nteach and build in your older life so that a younger you could be brought up to speed in life without as many hurdles as you went through, give your cheatsheet so they get life profit, and can build out more of the frontier. get them to the frontier faster by teaching and building\n\nlets dial up? do what scares you, for non-regrettal, long term things. according to deutsch its ethically neutral, but totally traditionally socially taboo, and reputational damage in one way but actually its a win when it comes to people believing my honesty so in that way it was good\n\nif someones a dick dont ignore them avoid em if you can. like angelo or insert asshole jerk: francois, just combative people like carlo pelkey elijah duck. they get their way in short term but they wont play the infinite game w me. punish give them an opportunity for betterment, punish etc.\n\nwhat did i learn from prostitution: being a virgin is fine, now i know about theory of sexual marketplace, i learned to err private, i learned about sos therapy nervous system loans, i learned to reconcile pagan and christian paradigms, i learned to not spend money on temporary only timeless\n\nsubscriiptions are perceived as "fuck ill forget about this and its gonna cost me" the only subscriptions i pay for are like spotify, phone bill, whoop, but these make more sense in that its timebased, dynamic, usage based. makes more sense that way idk, and the value is so important i dont mind that much\n\nsometimes the title of a book is the gist. i like the startup of you framing. the idea maze of your life applies to you just as much as startups. you can think long range about dots and scenarios ahead of you along the vector of your goals and metagoal, and when you encounter it, you arent blindsided and youre ready\n\nmake a twitter cheatsheet guide, have good reply game, post according to these rules and filtering questions. these are just guidelines, take in what you like, ignore what you dont like. repost what you wish youd have said. take notes in private. use "from:username keyword" in search bar to find what you want. etc etc\n\nmake diff twitter accounts for diff topics?
