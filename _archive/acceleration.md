e/acc seems like a cult, but i like it lol

cults and religion... like what marc andreessenn pointed out. oh humanity...

for people born in 2050, people born in 2000 are more like people born in 1900, to us new millenial beings.

acceleration is great if were pointed in the right direction

how do you know youre in the right direction? philosophy no?
PMF is escape velocity

time dampens or accelerates

it is not the end of history. and that can be scary and exciting at the same time. change is upon us

generate: speed and volume
curate: if there is doubt there is no doubt
excavate: push it to others

the best areas are the frontier, with no map, and you need correct axioms to derive first principles solutions where there are no easy answers

maybe i gotta push my code and media to accelerate the leverage. be known well.

leverage is anything where 1 decision actuates without you

speed from clarity from knowledge from experimentation from courage

with gatekeeper after gatekeeper. yes its permissionless leverage. anything else besides code and media? lemme max out both first. code is rarer

be the best in the world at what you do, keep redefining yourself until this is true. if i code and blog and podcast and hardware manufacturing and music and philosophy and sports, will i be the best in the world at THAT? the combinatorics, and economics

Maybe its not to their liking. Is starbase a network state? I just feel lost i dont know how i fit in here, im kinda just doing my own thing.. Id wanna help dad and vertical industries with payments, that would be a cash flowing thing i can do..\n\ni wonder if my hrv goes up when i get more wealth and less nervous system cheonic stress and its not play and necessity but just pure play and art. like what would you do if you had 10k 100k up the magnitudes. different projects take different scopes of resources. im growing my power. startung with one mag, then 2 then 3. mags are the metric\n\nonly work at a job if its your actual fuckin aligned idea and people. if youd work on it anyway, or the job plugs you into leverage/resources which help you work on a higher scoped / resource intensive/gated project you both couldnt work on otherwise AND you genuinely want to work on. like id work in starfarms if i could/wanted to badly enough\n\nget the stupid apps working on local. check discord announcements. make sure i have shit to show for buildathon. apply to fellowship v1 and v2? at least check the announcement and learn more on the website if i can apply. it could outright solve the whole problem of de.. but why would they choose me anyway? on Apr 22, 2025 at 8:00 AM - 8:30 AM\n\nwhoop api sleep leaderboard too with people you know irl, dont die? also you can set up recovery exercise accountability. everytime youre recovered above 33% for example, you have to exercise, and the app will know. sleep and exercise are positive sum things to *compete on. humans have a competitive and violent side to em deep down? like shadow like kyuubi\n\ni want a mix of acoustic original songs, cover songs, creative coding songs, and splice stack songs. solve big problems using specific knowledge, wrapped in accountability, with permissionless code and media leverage. yeah using ai + creative coding + visuals audio, this is stacking. and make the music amazing to actually get famous via visible competence. skill stack\n\nbe aware when newer techs costs come down because then suddenly with the capital you got or can summon, an economic engine solution becomes economical. see terraform for example. there will always be problems, experiements reveal knowledge, with that knowledge we solve, with scale and knowledge cost comes down, there will always be problems(dukkha), repeat ad infinitum\n\nEven if i do a small app, build and sell it, its not a big thing. If i go for a bigger thing, its more meaningful but i fear i wont make it. If it does not break physics it is possible. This is where potential comes in. self-actualization? I dont like a cold world though.. Why am i so afraid. What small thing can i approach? Divide and conquer. Just do what i think is right i guess idk..\n\ndo the presale thing. it generates funds, shows market demand, shiws im a good thinker, can attract collaboration. and actually execution is more important. well ideas are important but useless if nothing is done with them. and the worst xase is actually a good case: the world has those ideas. ok cool ill go. levels and musk do it and it makes sense after further thinking and soundboarding\n\nwhat is my current wow project? do i need one? check AM. check code project spreadsheet, show a landing page and sales and shit. helping dad w container farm, doing ns, learning, seeking deep understanding on the frontiers of knowledge and deep conviction for a unique founder product market fit project for wealth and fame creation. the right kind of fame from the right people. and preselection\n\ni have to remember that the network state project isnt necessarily about this particular network state succeeding: network school -> a network state, but its about the antifragile collection of network states. the "network states of the internet" the choice, the containerized experiments. its like how the survival of the species is more important the survival of any one person, for example, yaknow?\n\n- 100 apps 100 essays 100 songs. indiepage substack soundcloud? distrokid spotify? where is the middleroom, not the backroom not the frontroom, the experimentation room, the tinkering garage. is indiepage the place to put it? of check if there are better uiux displays for github projects? or maybe just post github, but upgrade the readmes for clarity and aesthetics, also my github readme profile one\n\n- ideally, you earn with just your mind. let levers do the heavy lifting. - transformations, not time - money comes naturally as a result of service - by endurance we conquer - code and media leverage. marketing and sales - accountability is skin in the game - i know in principle my problems can be solved - conqueror's Haki - the man in the arena is always better - the first apple sale was made barefoot\n\nshow formula/checklist of each startup idea and what percentage ive progressed till its ready. still cooking... then people can help fund and accelerate a certain project. crowdfund. community fund me please lol. ask family and friends too to help if they want a certain thing. dont include the investing in people idea because i havent escaped its idea maze yet. only work on ideas ive escaped the idea maze on\n\nas long as your growth rate is solid, doesnt matter your starting point, your y int. just gotta be sustainable profit and expenses wise. fixed and percentage growth or costs. keep expenses low, as long as more money comes in than out, youre sustainable. this is what i gotta figure out post singapore. check bella express and IDI (whats the pay though? i want project based pay. but i gotta build leverage.) things that work in my sleep\n\n- action produces information - stop focusing on runway, start focusing on liftoff - experience > theory - kaizen - results validate. only with more credibility / results, will my words carry more weight - feel + flow - time is what life is made of - follow the fun - easy choices hard life, hard choices easy life - "figure out what works, and do it." - LKY - what would this look like if it were easy? - founder product market fit - let go\n\nif the ns boat doesnt sink and we recruit contribute stay, wealth is solved. so were getting really clear on the boat chartered course / roadmap and identifying the critical path mindmap of the book. ** but wealth creation theory talk. cryptocredential quiz to be sure you know the person understands the concepts before entering an event..? like a captcha before a luma event. ugh ** also sales depends on whose doing the chasing.. sep shit\n\nIm practicing risk for the sake of risk. I cant know everything before deciding, even if i want to know before i act, but there are diminishing returns. Like go to 80% knowledge, then shoot shot. Its a waste of time. Optimal failure. For optimal success, thats like a sacrifice. I need to put my denominator of failure on the line, to increase my numerator of wins. Winning defined as achieving what you sent out to do. Your intent was fulfilled\n\nif mentorship in a given field leads to 2 sigma improvements, then proximity/location matters. that is what im learning. i need to move to where my heroes are. looking like LA or austin. i think austin is where its at, but defense manufacturing? but code and media? learning, grants, code and media, and singapore atdm planning and other top tasks and aydin gokce is what im doing august, september, october, early november. hopefully chenchule' comes\n\nns abstracts away everyday complexity. the food cleaning etc. it frees up time and mental space to focus on the important and urgent stuff. i got used to it, went back to “regular life” and now i see the value. its not perfect but nothing is, theyre constantly trying to improve. constructive criticism, highlighting errors and imperfections, then we just correct them. this is the engine of progress. we need explanations too yadda yadda. put this in ns long chat too\n\n- 100 clips. 100 apps. - be strong, be good. - where am i messing up? fix that. - hang around wealth creators and guys with great girlfriends. - do show tell do show tell. - be high quality and high authenticity. - i got to walk, then talk - remove the root cause bottlenecks to solving your top problems, and nothing else? - "productize yourself" - be a perfect wealth creator, then just create. how? - just correct errors. - simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.\n\nelon used to be a loser. you can change your win rate. work on increasing your numerator, no matter the denominator of losses. in principle you can get to the top of the power law dominance heirarchy. you cant change the shape, but you can move up the shape. is this zero sum? well sometimes i notice that supposedly positive sum games, still increase you in the zero sum. maybe this has to do with the calculus of orchestration of life. you shouldnt exert more energy than you have to\n\nwrite with jangle about whats happening at ns, what are the implications at each stage, each milestone. make it a nobrainer for why its a good project. its not EXACTLY about this instantiation, its about the "network states of the internet". "why im living at ns. for 1 year. for the school part and i like how it influences the state part" make it dead simple to understand the roadmap and why it matters. ** balaji is like a scifi author that is also building it out. making fiction fact.\n\ni love this quality of life measurement, awareness, vetting of ideas, deliberate improvement of life. life is surrounded by problems. problems arent the problem lol, its you ability and knowledge about the problems thats the problem. if you have infinite problems but infinite solution ideas and infinite leveraged action and judgement, life is a fun game where you play. meaning can be found in the motion of life. happiness is peace in motion? happiness is a loaded term it can mean meaning or hedonism\n\nedit the ben pod riverside thing, and minimalize my ig and post to x? what rules whats my decision tree of undersfanding for what content goes where?

maybe i just gotta make money as a pickup techie.. like pickup soccer. idk.. i can be a smart rust contract or something.. elon is michael jordan basically, he's messi. the better you are in tech, the more you realize how great he is at this game. he is gol d. roger.. he is the pirate king. i mean steve jobs was the previous guy\n\nuse ben and marine’s thread as examples for the thread. ill talk with ben about threadmaking i think. idk i just dont want it to take a ton of time each day cause people want me to code and stuff too. check his and marines examples and have gpt take all my notes and help me write threads. but what length?

why am i qualified to speak on this. i went to sg for xyz met with xyz, learned to code, made my own business, got out of debt, travelled to tech hubs, its been 4 years since highschool. i have a lot i think i could teach to you guys. i think therell be only a few here who will really reap from what i have to say. the eye atop the pyramid. atop is at the top. i like how language compresses meaning too\n\ni now know i hate permissioned gates and gatekeepers, i used to try to kiss ass and get software opportunities, but deep down it felt so fake. now i understand the landscape of value creation, being honest to myself and others, it feels less needy, i used to feel gross about that. its like i was begging for jobs, and i dont blame myself too much, that was and still is my biggest prioritiy: career/wealth. so idk now im just focusing on permissionless meritocratic wealth creation methods. code media equity, leverage, problem solving with my upgraded detection skills for "luck" positive outcomes from known sources\n\nfind startup ideas at the frontier, it almost has to be. at the frontier it becomes less smooth, and you see rigid pillars of the frontier fractal sticking out, then you can connect the dots at the edges, and as humanity moves outward into the previous frontier, you reap from having providing the solution, solving it before people know how. like naval says: creating what society wants but doesnt know how to get. so baked in that is knowing rare skills, solving actual problems, and living in the future means youre at the frontier. being principled means you can be at the frontier (noones there) with more confidence\n\nits amazing how clearly i see and understand the systems in life, how the game works under the hood. i feel so fuckin empowered, its only a matter of time before i pretty definitively solve my biggest problem: wealth creation: permissionless leverage: anchor marianas indiehacking. combine permissionless leverage synergies like code * equity * media, then every bit of capital reinvest in the code and shit like super ninja intentional ads or something where th customers are. code equity media capital labor relationships. use capital to move to the hub: check nomadlist ns for example, edge city, the popup village network state ecosystem/s\n\npay attention to sufficient variables, principles. articulation is clarity is flow: clear goals, immediate feedback, challenge-skills balance. Aim up ∞ Copy less. never forget the Deutschian lens. if it does not break the laws of physics, it is absolutely possible. don't you want to live? to feel alive? propositional, procedural, perspectival, participatory. if nothing changes, nothing changes. never the past, always forward. would my deathbed self approve? immense reward comes after the sacrifice. don't you want to live? Do not look around to others, only look up to God. fierce baby steps. Caffeine. salient articulation. keep things insanely simple\n\ndo more in person type of performances that show visible competence. practice online and offline. my big 5: philosophy startups, soccer health music. show visible competence, go where that kind of person already goes. actually be good. practice practice, be genuine and high quality. philosophy for solutionsociety, show it on social media and talk about it. every sunday for 1-3, pick a better time?. startups and tech at the makerspace classes, but dont forget about online. you need to take calculated risks to solve top problems, i think these in person classes and shit are up my alley and can really help solve the 2 problems? figure out debt for sure\n\nthe whole point of "do 100 thing." is to raise your natural quality, THROUGH quantity. use your best judgement. like with technology — you get better, faster, cheaper. your warm-up used to be your PR. it comes more naturally as you practice. holy shit this is making sense. i'm becoming more convinced of this "do 100 thing" practice ethos. you can get better at anything if you commit to trying it 100 times. i usually suffer from perfectionism — and it's good to have high standards of quality — but how do you reach that standard? by "crossing the sea of imperfection." step by step, knowing full well that mistakes are inevitable — but taking steps anyway.\n\nexplanations connect your values and goals. learning explanations is meaningful because they are the map to your goals. i learned the meta lesson of explanations and now ill seek explanations in every arena or game. win and help win, like investing mentoring apprenticeshipping. ship fast. speed is the common denominator. who doesnt like speed. better faster cheaper, this serves you and your society. then ill get societal IOUs (monies) which lessens my stress, increases T increases smv, increases mobility and independence, increases hrv because less neevous strain stress. all good things. solve the bottom half of maslow in a few moves(game vocab applied)\n\n00 pareto front: debt: 3 loneliness: 2 sexlessness: 3 - what would this look like if it were easy?

i can think of DMs emailing me like derek sivers, calendly calls, airchat, whatsapp, voice call, discord, what else? ive been thinking a lot about how the internet is sorta responsible for the loneliness epidemic, but ive been wanting to fight fire with fire and use the internet against itself and use the internet to make more friends, then eventually go from url to irl and be irl with the internet friends youve made\n\nwrite about do 100 thing experiments. i first did 100 tweets, now im gonna do 100 internet products / startups. i can also note the time between each repo, self study. i can analyze why i made each, why each failed etc. bettering my understanding of software ideas. problem understanding action. why i wanna do 100 startups: money, inspired by visa's do 100 things, i dont wanna overweight 1 idea, i wanna minimize it in a good way. i wanna practice volumism on what i love, minimalism on what i dont, inspired by pieter level's pic of 75+ failed startups, hes the indiehacking frontiersman, just like elon is the general technologist's frontiersman / benchmark / standard. generate curate elevate. creating a power law curve, then ill curate later, well also the market curates FOR me. and word of mouth elevates.\n\nso what am i going for?

stability and dynamism by themselves arent virtues. its about fast, cheap, good progress, durable\n\nmake the unconscious conscious within and without. learn math physics game theory programming sales. but also meaning making history mythological literature etc.\n\ni think 1517fund may suffer from an innovators dilemma. but honestly their results validate their process so dont listen to me lol theyre doing great, a fan of em\n\nthere are actually few quality songs. if we get cost curves down (all resources) we get positive emergent properties. dont leave life knowledge wealth on the table\n\njust post 100 blog short ass blog posts, i can always curate. just fuckin generate curate elevate. ok cool with a small pic i think. automate the blog markdown thingy\n\ni live mostly online and offline is kind of a misaligned tax sadly. but that will change when i empower myself and go from url to irl, heaven and earth aligned like eden\n\nremember to experiment in breadth, then when you find a hit or you are sure that 1 way will be really good, switch to experimentation of depth. iteration then repitition\n\na network state can succeed like the mars party with elon as the leader, he can get more funding. a timeline of kpis can be like "landed on mars" self-sustainable society\n\nyou dont know how smart you can be (youll see things you cant see now) unless you got more neurons, theyre configured better (best books/experiences etc), best sleep etc.\n\ni want to do this but its dangerous so i want to learn more so i can avoid the bad and gain the good. cap downsides take asymmetric bets. dont bet the farm bet the tractor\n\nim going to zero to one on a small digital scale. models for all zero to one projects, scaling, end to end business. this is an education on technology and wealth creation.\n\nsometimes i get tired of philosophy, i like wealth creation, trying to stay away from other games no porn no games, play the highest game i can : life wealth knowledge life\n\n4 squares for hower logo? idk just use the logofast one for now, but SOMETHING special? idk lol just go fast. race to first dollar, speed is the goal rn the directive rather\n\nwe trust that a kid or a drunk is not lying about who they are. i think thats why we drink to accelerate trust like japanese business, also we trust good kids from our childhood\n\nrespond to berkeley wanner on x. talk to mama about ns, but get first dollar? to prove that i can go from zero to one. tell both of them, so im not going to ns in a worse position\n\nyour explanatory gets you from starting point to goal state. the desire the meaning the relevance is all along that path. experiments reveal the shape of the path from here to there\n\npeople dont know yet how to become internet-born. most people are NOT online, and therefore internet-unborn. its like a new higher dimension if you wanna visualize it/frame it that way\n\nmusk is a pragmatic idealogue with great capacity for iteration speed and great leaps within those iterations, hes the messi of business. a business savant according to his brother kimbal\n\nfor presales on ideas, get funding, show percentage of progress, what features im coding up. only have actually relevant ideas to me on there. build what i cant buy AND is relevant to me 2x2\n\nits like valuevaluevalue layer layer layer on top, so we have 1 foot in the cloud state, then when the legacy state fails we put both feet on the cloud state, and the cloud comes down to land\n\neven visa himself only has 5 mags on x and like 4 on ig youtube. i can be like that in the sweet spot. ill start to worry at 6 mags and slowdown. i think itll be a longer road to increase mags\n\nproduct * scale * time. thats where elon falls apart because he doesnt take care of his health. zuck is younger so age per wealth (product*sales), arguably hes doing best. its like yonkou shit\n\nim at 3 mags with people knowing my face and name. dial it up to 4 mags and reevaluate, thats a great experiment, im increasing my fame portfolio 3 mags irl and 1 mag url. 0to1 leveraging internet\n\nill take what the indiehackers do and elevate, like OG soccer players came up with innovations and playbook from first principles frontier navigation, then i can build on the giants and be a giant\n\nand then with network states, you agree on value vector, then kpis for those vectors. values are vectors, kpis measure the scalar? the progress along that direction. timelines, aligned-crowdsolved\n\nbounce ideas off friends along vectors for dialogos insights. we need more vectorized group chats and podcasts. LEVERAGE THE INTERNET. its a hidden cloud continent we dont even conceptualize properly\n\nif i subtract my subtractors and solve my top 2 problems: wealth creation sexual opportunity, then my cortisol goes down, testosterone goes up, hrv goes up. so solving problems IS a part of longevity\n\nindividual upgrades the tribe I want my merits and projects to come back to me in karma, but I don’t want the downsides of unchangeable risky fame like DNA face name things that I can’t change star star\n\ncurate your feeds: ig x gmail cal who youre with what you do youtube no porn no video games. make music make video games. dont make music cause its competing? permissionless genuines leverage. zero to one\n\ni can learn what a master learned 10 years to learn in 1 year... amazing. doing more with less. on and on throught time. ill do that 10 times, then someone can learn from me what took me 10 years, in 1 year.\n\ndo time tech: notice every time your time is taken away and intervene on that. thats why i gotta make money then live on my own so i get my time back, but in a cheap place like nomadlist cheaps or NS url2irl\n\nmake 1 minute videos until i get people watching, then 2 minute, then 4 minutes then 8, increasing length when theres more people watching. so short volume sticky, THEN long depth quality. 2 independent things\n\nwhat am i afraid of that i must do? launch 100 reps of code and media and equity, generate curate elevate. do the post dollar things and go to ns? but why? it may save cash if mama will pay. maybe we can go halfsies?\n\nmost depressed people are that way cause globalization accelerates status and seretonin cascades, also we need more explanations and understanding so people can solve their problems. i think BoI and vervaeke can relate\n\ndubai may be more spiky in certain ways, i like singapore because its more solarpunk, i like its well roundedness and pragmatism and i relate to its culture more. from mudflat to metropolis. LOVE it. economies run on credit\n\nand globalization will be a quantum leap in human history unforeseen on the scale maybe there are similarities and history, but this has never happened before this is a one time event at least an inflection point I don’t know\n\ni like it when david senra re reviews a book, i like that. like revisit a tweet, a concept. put your mind online but only the timeless and public-compliant. hard boundaries for whats private and public, irl and url, same thing\n\nhave internal docs to myself with functions like stripe and firebase, stuff that repeats when i do this process, and maybe add to boilerfork with some readme for functions. specify whats DIFFERENT with each idea and whats the SAME\n\ni outgrow teachers sometimes. better to explore find the handful of s tier and then repeat repeat repeat fundamentalize w the top of your taste. they are along that wealth creation top goalstate and salience. thats why you like em\n\nget a weifhted blanket? upgraded sleep pillow? 8sleep cheap chinese version? america shouldnt compete on manufacturing its inherently centralized. they should work on high importance high knowledge advanced automated manufacturing alone\n\neven if hower fails* its about learning how to go from idea to market in speed. i should also measure time to market from the moment the repo is made. speed. analyze bottleneck, question and delete parts of process, simplify what remains\n\nyou need discipline. social motivation VERY much helps. ar will be great with this, like interacting with real people in the form of holograms around you, then you meetup irl. you can have an avatar like in SAO. i like urlirl interactions\n\nmore job displacement, more job creation, need for reskilling. what to learn? whats valuable. what is that? what are the big problems? what are you good at? what plays can you make with the cards you got? permissionless leverage for wealth\n\nupdate mama every few days on anchor marianas progress. get the x and y axis in order= 1 internet dollar from selling web comparrow. a system for generating curating elevating any startup idea i have, in elegant effective frugal orchestration\n\nhumans are cray cray, we accumulatively build civilization, it wasnt just THESE living people on the planet that built the roads and buildings, it was also past generations. imagine what were gonna build as we accelerate. a trickle then a tsunami\n\ni need to finish by tomorrow. first dollar by tomorrow. by 10 17 it will be 2 weeks. whats a good deadline for tiny startup mvps? with more practice to first dollar i can get much faster. nail it before scale it. make more and bigger good fires/leverage\n\nget wealthy, find a nice girl, have enough to build a family with 3 kids, then youve done your part with fertility crisis lol. or do more. this is a transitory period. we are going into the new age. what do we call it? nietzsche and jung predicted this?\n\nmerge to main (my mosaic) from the best wealth creators, and the best sexual marketplace actors. find kpis like net worth in short term, and girlfriend, or good with women in short term? but maybe have a life with one great girl idk. experiment with breadth first\n\nif you increase your life slope, even if your y int sucks, i feel more vertical now so my stress has lessened because now i just know its a matter of time and diligence, and im quite sure i can make wealth and solve my main problem. maslow quest1 complete? soon...\n\nthiel articulated that in the past we used to ask about feasibility. i like thiel and balaji because they are students of histories and they prove with real examples that this human config is infact possible and it HAS happened or IS already here on some dimension\n\nthrough goals, values, progress, explanatory knowledge for your goals and genuine curiosity, you become a startup idea world scanner, you increase the conversion of time-to-startup-idea SCANNER in your mind. you just start to train yourself TO SEE VALUE everywhere.\n\nill be like an iceberg: massive, slow to start, but unstoppable. speed up through the elon algo: question delete optimize accelerate automate. dont speed up till you find a working strategy. the good thing about code is that i write once and it serves customers forever*\n\nwith super low tunnels, imagine boring company surveying and digging deep, then having an elevator 3d gantry that brought you to destination. first down, then around, then back up. super engineering. get cost curves down with innovation and higher supply economies of scale\n\nsay that i bring longevity coding to the table. im bullish on this vision and i can prove with my workout nft proving i eas there showing my agency, i paid for priority app, i made friends, im willing to finance the full 3 minths. i indiehack, you can check my site for prooof\n\ngo as fast as you can SUSTAIN growth. growth is good generally. ethically economically etc. but dont overburst growth if it jeapordizes Long term growth. sounds kinda degrowthy but i do not mean that let me be clear. im just saying put one step in front of the other, dont OVERSTEP\n\nshow success before asking for help. oh yeah and grants will help out a ton, and wallets open in proportion to mags of revenue you can show. decrease burn increase earn. become a digital sovereign individual then build the beginning of infinity, i guess were always at the beginning lol\n\nbe powerful and good. how? empower yourself with permissionless leverage for example, learn the timeless explanations: the great books, math, programming, physics (STEM). the great myths and literature, the great films, the great songs idk. health: sleep diet exercise. remember 9010 rule\n\nscaffolding makes me confident in principles. i know this will work because component 1 2 3 are solid, so conclusion/goal state 4 will happen, it doesnt break laws of physics, if premise premise are good, boom conclusion will work. learning how to be a mini naval, balaji, thiel, elon, lky\n\nthe civ tech tree is a great analogy (perpetual learning lets me see this). there should be xyz, and lets see what team is working on it or if it exists, if not i build it, or be the ideas capital guy to catalyze it being built, while still contributing. be a fuckin amazing capital allocator\n\nmy indiehacking businesses are market experiments like music, and you can adjust poker-like resource allocation based on conviction and data. like the balaji civ tech tree analogy with trunks and roots and leaves. leaves become roots become trunks. have strong mental explanatory scaffolding and xyz\n\npeople are being born into the online dimension. i only got serious online maybe the last 1-2 years. now im actually gonna be prolific. up my mags of posting. visakanv is at 260k tweets. oof 260,000 thats 6 mags. mags are the tiers. like that one company that had a logarithmic dashboard lol of kpis\n\nfor presales page, show ETA on each project. which one im focusing on, my estimate on how long (weeks) each will take, and a completion wheel, ill be updating (show xyz days ago). the presales have a ladder of commitment. practice transactions with minimal clicks. make 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 bucks options\n\nwhen a problem is solved, that class of problems is permanently solved, this is the value of sharing ideas, just like in capitalism if you solve your problem, SELL IT so others have it too and we can stand on each others shoulders, and not repeat the same mistakes. THIS IS WHY WE SHARE IDEAS AND PRODUCTS\n\nits not JUST about hower, its about ALL my code leverage project ideas + stripe to meet the market. through REPITITIONS, experimentations in breadth, i get better at breadth altogether, same with depth. i dont owe anyone but myself. well i owe mama, i owe society. but ill do it my way. use momentum and flow\n\nexplore experiment. do more what worked less what didnt. when i find something sufficiently satisyingly good, repeat the fuck out of it: sleep math indiehacking permissionless leverage wealth creation. each community is a mosaic of values. i like indiehacking i can do this long term its like a game that helps the meta game\n\nuse tech to no downside increase my height. i mean if you were a short guy wouldnt you increase your height with gene therapy? like restart your growth plates then hgh makes you grow, then fuse em back together. use natural ways to better yourself and tech ways. tamed nature comprehensive tech. to be technical is to be human\n\nwith futuristic friends you also get early access to info and therefore understanding and therefore wealth and therefore life. with more wealth im gonna have more kids baby and be a great father, a walled garden for my kids. now thats fuckin ethical, and also dont die too. wonder if i can orchestrate my life elegantly that way\n\ni wonder if my hrv goes up when i get more wealth and less nervous system cheonic stress and its not play and necessity but just pure play and art. like what would you do if you had 10k 100k up the magnitudes. different projects take different scopes of resources. im growing my power. startung with one mag, then 2 then 3. mags are the metric\n\nwealth goal: no debt, engine of wealth via code and media leverage, and capital allocation, and labor allocation, what other leverage? and more earn than burn on a weekly basis. weekly reassessments of what needs to change in terms of breadth or depth experiments (i have to do something different vs i have to double down on this thing thats working)\n\noh surfing and sailing are great life analogies. i LOVE vector math analogies, also vector sum is good. you can stray off the straight and narrow, and maybe the pain will keep you closer to the path, because you know how much it hurts being off it, and maybe it catalyzes going down the path MUCH MUCH faster because it means more and its recontextualized\n\nthe best thing the startup of you taught me was that im basically a startup, all the same practices and analogies basically apply. i didnt like the actual book that much lol barely listened to it. i dont like reading purists. conversation was original, reading was a newer psychotechnology. like how podcasting is arguably tkmeless becuase its humans conversing\n\ni need isolation to cook, maybe going ns isnt the way? its good for making friends and working out but it would add expenses, and i wanna cook and do the milestone thing. to make friends though for sure go to those adjacent ecosystem crypto popups and make friends. play the long game. we need focus to get stuff done. ns is a club and thats great for talent curation\n\nfinish anchor marianas presales and digital store page. show 1 finished product before asking for presales, and ask for grants after 1 customer. show success before asking for help. and after anchorm site is done, email lemonsqueezy to get it done. add stripe, lemonsqueezy, and phantom wallet buttons. a solana blink? a phantom wallet solana usdc for microtransactions\n\ndo the presale thing. it generates funds, shows market demand, shiws im a good thinker, can attract collaboration. and actually execution is more important. well ideas are important but useless if nothing is done with them. and the worst xase is actually a good case: the world has those ideas. ok cool ill go. levels and musk do it and it makes sense after further thinking and soundboarding\n\non ig after i finish hower and anchor marianas presale site, do ig post for visible competence: pointing to hower and the presales dashboard, eta on how long to build each, the value i think, completion dashboard based on my checklist. percentage color coded wheel both for accountability and for progress tracking. maybe update this monthly like now page. now page rent and indiehacking dashboard update\n\nshow formula/checklist of each startup idea and what percentage ive progressed till its ready. still cooking... then people can help fund and accelerate a certain project. crowdfund. community fund me please lol. ask family and friends too to help if they want a certain thing. dont include the investing in people idea because i havent escaped its idea maze yet. only work on ideas ive escaped the idea maze on\n\nmake hower for me + some consideration for edge cases. elon said you can make incase arguments ad naseum so question delete optimize accelerate automate. dont speed up till you get something REALLY right quotes or pic of the day. you can choose in settings to modularize, feature request, turn on or off features. give feedback in ideabugs and ill pick the best, people can vote on em too, and ill show the ones i pick on stove"" and progress bar. the value, speed, and accountability wheel (percentage with ring around it and a color spectrum based on the number\n\nlet kids be more of adults more work and responsibility and learning and skillbuilding and shit teach em skills of the new age. do an fd workshop on skills for the new age? why am i qualified to speak on this. i went to sg for xyz met with xyz, learned to code, made my own business, got out of debt, travelled to tech hubs, its been 4 years since highschool. i have a lot i think i could teach to you guys. i think therell be only a few here who will really reap from what i have to say. the eye atop the pyramid. atop is at the top. i like how language compresses meaning too\n\nfind startup ideas at the frontier, it almost has to be. at the frontier it becomes less smooth, and you see rigid pillars of the frontier fractal sticking out, then you can connect the dots at the edges, and as humanity moves outward into the previous frontier, you reap from having providing the solution, solving it before people know how. like naval says: creating what society wants but doesnt know how to get. so baked in that is knowing rare skills, solving actual problems, and living in the future means youre at the frontier. being principled means you can be at the frontier (noones there) with more confidence\n\nits amazing how clearly i see and understand the systems in life, how the game works under the hood. i feel so fuckin empowered, its only a matter of time before i pretty definitively solve my biggest problem: wealth creation: permissionless leverage: anchor marianas indiehacking. combine permissionless leverage synergies like code * equity * media, then every bit of capital reinvest in the code and shit like super ninja intentional ads or something where th customers are. code equity media capital labor relationships. use capital to move to the hub: check nomadlist ns for example, edge city, the popup village network state ecosystem/s\n\nexplanations connect your values and goals. learning explanations is meaningful because they are the map to your goals. i learned the meta lesson of explanations and now ill seek explanations in every arena or game. win and help win, like investing mentoring apprenticeshipping. ship fast. speed is the common denominator. who doesnt like speed. better faster cheaper, this serves you and your society. then ill get societal IOUs (monies) which lessens my stress, increases T increases smv, increases mobility and independence, increases hrv because less neevous strain stress. all good things. solve the bottom half of maslow in a few moves(game vocab applied)\n\nso what? ok im down for 5-6 mags "followers", so... tweet timeless bangers, ship code, post visible competence on instagram, dont PUSH my face, but let it be known, so no face profile pics, but ok on banners, posts, stories. i just want to be intentional. then track mags of revenue, twitter ig followers, get into podcasting buy a mic? or riverside. make a dashboard of product and sales, for wealth creation and sexual marketplace. be confident. ignore let her initiate, i do not pay for sex. then chop up and short form content: tik tok youtube reels ig short form. twitter is short from blogging, and chop up podcast into clips too. ok im doin it, im gonna be on the internet.\n\non now page, put date, and also put that im working on anchor marianas my indiehacking company, come see my presale page where i list all the ideas im cookin on on my stove, presales, what each idea does, how progressed i am on each, there will be a store for the finished mvp prototypes, speed value price, and youll be notified when done and you get an nft for supporting(can come in handy later). post on ig and ask twitter and ig and whatsapp for help prefunding these ideas, pick which ones would be useful to you and it informs the market demand(ill know which ones to work on first because you put your money where your mouth is. and its good stripe lemon squeezy phantom practice.\n\nwrite about do 100 thing experiments. i first did 100 tweets, now im gonna do 100 internet products / startups. i can also note the time between each repo, self study. i can analyze why i made each, why each failed etc. bettering my understanding of software ideas. problem understanding action. why i wanna do 100 startups: money, inspired by visa's do 100 things, i dont wanna overweight 1 idea, i wanna minimize it in a good way. i wanna practice volumism on what i love, minimalism on what i dont, inspired by pieter level's pic of 75+ failed startups, hes the indiehacking frontiersman, just like elon is the general technologist's frontiersman / benchmark / standard. generate curate elevate. creating a power law curve, then ill curate later, well also the market curates FOR me. and word of mouth elevates.\n\n
