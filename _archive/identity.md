i dont like being labelled

i dont have a problem saying what i am, but i dont like being limited idk

im aiming for polymathy i guess. why? why not?

also. if i learn from others and borrow all their thoughts, who am i then? what thoughts are my own?

topics that are important to me:

women like sex


who you admire reveals your values

what you can be sure of and be honest about is who do you like, who do you admire?

we are not our worst deed, we are capable of it but not it.

maybe i can have a stage name. adam SOMETHING

personal monopoly, who am i, what am i uniqely good for?

make it so you are not fungible, you cant just be replaced. you do this by self actualizing and being authentic. super super authentic

live so YOU like YOU

your character will show through the volume and time, so even if you mess up, you have counterevidence



i dont have to be well known but can be known well

we hide and hide. weaknesses. streissand effect
timesheet
nobody would be the same if they could afford to be different. if the agent could overpower the arena
what lies am i unanimously complicit in?

noone chose their ethnicity

noone chose their ethnicity

am i divergent because i just am or did i choose to, i wanted to be different? different doesnt mean good or bad it just means different. i deviate sometimes by nature, sometimes by choice

talk about being off socials whole life then now on socials. i didnt want to get famous, i didnt identify like that, like a popular jock person, i was more smart artsy, but now im more into extroverted athletic stuff too. i wanna live a full life
