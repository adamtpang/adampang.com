from an early age, i didnt believe in traditional schooling

i loved learning, was always curious, and i did well at school at first, but later it became a chore (see healthy gamer's gifted kid vid)

and i watched a nathaniel drew vid, and along with thiel, convinced me not to go to college

i would try to make it on my own, upskill myself, learn and have skills > credentials

im still trying to make it work so dont listen to me till i got the results to backup my choices

and anyways, now that ive had time, if i do ever go to school, id know which areas to get a major in and have more conviction around it (id choose something like mechanical, nuclear, physics, maths)

1517fund is a good resource to look at too. i never asked them for money, just advice. shoutout to harry gandhi

im a youtube university alum i guess

ill see if i get into the network school
