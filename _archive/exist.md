dust.

so what?

its all on sand.

popperian knowledge.

the new will soon be old.

it all goes to zero then.

falsifiable epistemology.

there are systems at work.

why care only about humanity?

popper was so right from the start.

explanations tested against reality.

what is that epistemological math formual?

well we care first about ourselves, then outward.

but we still have a lineage, an unbroken chain of life.

what we do still echoes through to the future of humanity.

there was a point where all people on this planet didnt exist.

if i cant break it, but i gotta test too, i wont know\n\nwhat if i die?

im interested in what matters, on the timeless.\n\ntry to break this idea.

the one that takes into account stats and chances of something with new info?\n\n

there may very well be a point where all people on this planet wont exist anymore, and will be forgotten by the sands of time.

im doing DONT DIE but still entropys a bitch\n\ntruth seekers converge on truth, youll see them since you align on epistemology vector\n\nmaybe the oedipal complex exists because our mothers worked lol, darwinianly.

just like einsteins test\n\nwhen a master tells about something along the oath it wont make suoer sense till you actually encounter what they pointed to when you encounter it in the oath, and trust is built because what they said came true.
