the new will soon be old. there was a point where all people on this planet didnt exist. there may very well be a point where all people on this planet wont exist anymore, and will be forgotten by the sands of time. its all on sand. dust. but we still have a lineage, an unbroken chain of life. so what? what we do still echoes through to the future of humanity. why care only about humanity? well we care first about ourselves, then outward. im interested in what matters, on the timeless.\n\n
