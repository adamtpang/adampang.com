a great critique creates nuance in a theory

a degree is a status thing, the university is a talent aggregator, its cost rises, its a luxury brand

a great critique creates nuance in a theory

girard came up with a great theory that explains anthropological, political, economic phenomena

the lie of degree not kind. the lie lies in its unanimity. johnathan bi

we are collectively writing the newest testemant. when did we stop writing testaments. someone should curate the bible, modernize it / more accessible, and update a new testament VERY carefully. a new project that incorporates vervaeke and petersonian ideas. make it open source where it can fork and shit

nepotism at GPA

when you learn, your vocab and axiomatic frameworks change

a degree is a status thing, the university is a talent aggregator, its cost rises, its a luxury brand

i like long ranging thinkers, people that explore the idea maze, AND go through it

just continuously learn in free markets

what makes a so called intellectual? isnt it up to the listener to decide. there is no threshold from preartist to artist. its more about action no?

It’s my life and taking the steps to this westside school, later than most, can be harder to do. I don’t want to lose hope, I think I can get in, I might just need to publish a philosophical work, without the perfect, initial “discography” I want. I can get great SAT scores and great ACT scores; that gives me hope that my GPA can be accounted for. I feel scared, but I think that what I am doing now is the best I can do, so not to worry I guess.

Legal and Diplomatic Recognition: Challenge: The biggest hurdle is achieving diplomatic recognition from existing nation-states. Network states would need a legal framework or international acknowledgment to function as sovereign entities. Sources: Discussions on the practicalities of network states often highlight this issue, as seen in the explorations by Balaji himself and critiques like those on Charterless.\n\ni think even the mainstream and everyone, deep down knows k-12 and college esp are pretty bs, but since theres no clear 10x alternative. irl babysitting and practical life education based on diff family and cultural values (personalized) the masses dont jump ship. even though it costs them or their parents SOOOO much money and for what? i mean if you get good scholarships then maybe. but you may have mixed outcomes with the people curation you find: could be sheep, could be talent curation and good. ill give it that. arguably the best feature of the bundle. how to unbundle, improve, then bundle whats best and remains?\n\n
