i just agreed to do this 100 day writing challenge about ns with gigi, on a whim. but if i dont have a why i dont have a will. i wanna clarify why im doing it. rn im just doing it out of obligation, a commitment i made. maybe i can talk about commitments in todays post, and how i and some others signed up for 12 more months at ns, another commitment. i seem to thrive on commitments, because it binds me to a habitual way of living, so that even in my weaker moments, i made the commitment so i can summon more strength for it when i was 15, i asked my parents if i could go to online school. i saw other kids graduating early, and i desperately wanted to get out of prison (school), because it was bullshit, you weren’t learning anything relevant.\n\nfor local legends you can note down how games roughly went for you, areas to improve. and based on your own self assessment and what went right and wrong, you can improve and experiment next game, get feedback from players, like after a game everyone can rate their top highlighted player and worst player idk and see trends of your rating over time, can be used for league games too. can show local games on island, public private. group chats, invite only games, and importantly, based on your stats and height and stuff and age, you can get recommendations where you best play, and kpis to look out for and exemplars of the sport in each position with similar age/style/stats/height, and you have case studies. like for me i seem to be best as a short defender so i should study verratti\n\nyeah its pathetic. im a fucking human, i went to a prostitute, i wanted to have sex really badly. is that so fucking bad? its fucking pathetic, and sad yeah... but i fucking ask girls for their number (4 times), i got rejected 4 times, i work on myself, my health, my tech career, im not asking for pity, im just saying 100% ive been trying. ive been taking care of sleep diet exercise, hanging out, building a social circle. i fell into temptation like watching porn, i havent watched in like 3 years or something and im fucking proud of that. but to say that im not supposed to be sexual, thats fucked up, were fucking human, and the only reason were here talking is because our parents were sexual. IM FUCKING SEXUAL AND THATS OKAY. i go to therapy, i gotta talk about this, i gotta work on permissionless leverage. i like girls omg, and thats okay. i dont need to overcorrect for dad, i used to think being sexual was a sin or something, that rings true and makes sense on why i am how i am.\n\ni think the problem is that deutsch ethical worldview doesnt map onto my christian hardwiring. and i think that im morally pure but im not. i went to a prostitute. i can be lazy sometimes. i can be weak sometimes. i hate that. so be better! ok how? dont ask mama weak questions like that then. i asked her “do you think im as spoiled as AJ?” and she didnt respond. so i think she means yes. and i also asked at a bad time which makes me even more mad. i try to help where i can because she gives me so much: money, emotional support, time, a place to stay. but im so weak and small that i cant even pay for groceries the fuck! i gotta go back to ns i have to. i need to grow up. what does that even mean? well when i do things that “grownups do” ill feel more and more like that. so what? what do i have to do? i need to survive another 12 months at ns. maybe i shouldnt go back for christmas. i see it now. so what? claude on this. what must i do to feel like an adult, and be a mature useful responsible adult for my family? what must i do or not do? the reason im asking is because i myself think im spoiled and weak and all that shit. ok so what? youre not gonna kill yourself so you got to live as best you can. no matter what people say, its only what you do that will solve this self-esteem shit. so what do i do? 100 indiehack app journal on anchormarianas site?
