Like rinstas and finstas, i might like a person, but i dont like what they post on ig or x. I only want them in my physical feed if you will..\n\nWhen you follow someone, if youre in the same peer-range, it implicitly says “wanna be friends?” if you unfollow, it implicitly messages “i don’t wanna pay attention to you, let’s end this.”\n\nwhat i follow 1k on ig x warpcast? its sales in a way. its manual just like cookie clikcer. follow mute unfollow at will, dial up dial down, but dont follow guam people, maybe thats the rule. follow INTERNET people\n\nfigure out and write about a system of following and unfollowing and muting people on social media. so for apps essays songs, ill have show and ill have tell. my own collection vs what i share on feeds (signal / earning people attention in the stream)\n\nmodel ns after terrace house, what do they have that makes their society experience way better than here? like the forestick netflix and chill room w blankets and shit.. but imagine multiple rooms like that, not just a super public vip room and your room, spaces in between.. with comfy blankets and shit. we need to touch grass too and go on fieldtrips on Apr 19, 2025 at 7:30 AM - 8:00 AM\n\nig carousel w music: https://open.spotify.com/track/1Dg4dFJr3HW7sbA7vPejre?si=8AxH9ZbzSVaneew2vAdeYw. how to gain social status if that is desired by women..? 1 8020 step, add this to the top problem chat thing. 1 8020 ig step. filter down the liked pics. also for the pod, upload the 10 minute clips to substack? where will it postbridge too? Improve your visibility (Instagram, podcast, writing).\n\ni think part of internet fueled loneliness and meaning crisis is that we have access to so mang humans and our url parasocial relationships are stronger or more aligned than irl relationships. i think a solution would be to fight fire with fire and double down on using the internet to make friends. first broadcast 1-way: twitter youtube ig. and also have good reply game in comments and replies: making other peoples 1-ways, 2 ways\n\n
