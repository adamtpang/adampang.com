addiction is a bitch

in highschool, i had a really bad porn addiction

now im 2-3 years clean, i dont even remember the last time i watched porn

its so pervasive for guys, so even though its embarassing to write about, if i can help someone, its all worth it

the dopamine drain is a terrible toll to pay.

whenever im tempted, i just remember all the times ive tried to quit, and relapse, and i just know that its a living hell, like with any addiction

dm me for practical tips (at least what i know)
