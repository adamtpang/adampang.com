who else?

marc lou?

or only prebirth?

win and help win.

prove your merit.

i wanna see similarities.

helps with actionable steps.

and unlocks the gpt md app..

opponent processing for both.

transition into biotech after tech.

whcih are critical which are trici.

upgrade yourself and upgrade others.

can genetics only be edited pre or post birth?

on Apr 8, 2025 at 2:30 AM - 3:00 AM\n\nI took a genetics test.

I want it to come back positive for predisposition for depression.

cavities, iq, follostatin etc\n\nget a genetics test asap then tell kian.

tell him i dont need his app btw\n\ni didnt CHOOSE my genes, but i use it.

on Apr 24, 2025 at 12:30 noon - 1:00 PM\n\nkian genetics test asap once i get same mag mrr?

variantbio.com or whatever\n\nget dna test so im sure whats my genetic geographical portfolio.

etween different geographies and ethnicities\n\n

can we edit genes for height, iq, etc, post birth?

generation curation elevation\n\nyou can have tons of kids through your grandkids, exponential style.

i wanna map out what genes do what and which are more stable old deep and which are experimental new.

get into genetic coding, learn about this, and prospera roatan live gene editing, crispr shit, and what else?

then we can code with crispr (update and create access on repo?), then 3d print or synthetic incubation new humans?

if you cant found it, you dont deserve to inherit it.\n\nget dna test so im sure whats my genetic geographical portfolio.

also list my genetic weaknesses and what im looking for ideally in a gattaca orchid partner->kid\n\nif we get genetic repos.

go there eventually\n\na beautiful woman means durable, voluminous, quality genes for the genepool etc\n\nideas and genes are linked.

mew2 vibes\n\nif authencity beats competition, and authenticity is largely genetics, then be diff yet good genetics live editing engineering.

also list my genetic weaknesses and what im looking for ideally in a gattaca orchid partner->kid\n\ntech to grow in height in a natural way check genetics engineering live style.

The reason is that it gives an objective reason for it, and knowing that its literally not about me, its just the genes i spawned with, i gotta work WITH it.\n\nwith a genetic test you get to see your repo, then we can do correlational studies on best genes and combos.

even if you dont choose your memes, just use em if theyre good\n\ngenetic weights like a neural net, but a genetic net of skillpoints like in an rpg, a starting archetype, predispositions\n\nits a question of how easy is it to live edit genes or do we need to edit genes before birth or early states of life?

it doesnt break physics so...\n\nwhat if i solve being short lol, get taller, what if we can do genetic analysis on YOUR codebase, via nucleus genomics, and then look at all the genes that output to certain genetic outputs, and then if you can live edit a gene, like prospera roatan shit, then you can live get diff biological outputs: no cavities, get jacked, get taller, higher iq, etc.

and then eventually cloning.\n\nwhat if you could genetically dial toward the vectors of your heroes, literally your kids will get genetic data from your heroes, you have to buy their data just like a woman buys the best sperm on the sperm market, whether traditionally or literally buying it from a sperm bank\n\nwhat if we take the best genes from every genetic codebase and merge to main?

deviation selection

genetic weights like a neural net, but a genetic net of skillpoints like in an rpg, a starting archetype, predispositions

genetic weights like a neural net, but a genetic net of skillpoints like in an rpg, a starting archetype, predispositions

genetic weights like a neural net, but a genetic net of skillpoints like in an rpg, a starting archetype, predispositions\n\nmixed kids better?\n\nwrite about the genetic meta: high iq, OCean\n\ndesigner babies with genetics testing and crispr and simulations?\n\ntransitioning into the new age will have the most genetic change in a while i think\n\nuse genetic engineering to grow taller, just solve problems.
