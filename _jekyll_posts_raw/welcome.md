## Why Blog?

Thanks for reading.

Just words and ideas.

This is my first blog post.

Writing helps clarify thinking.

No comments, no social media buttons, no analytics tracking.

By putting ideas into words, we're forced to examine them more closely.

I wanted to create a simple, clean space to share thoughts and ideas - inspired by blogs like [nav.al](https://nav.al) and [sive.rs](https://sive.rs).

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- Technology and programming
- Ideas and observations
- Books and learning
- Whatever seems worth sharing

## Simple is Better

This blog is intentionally minimal.
