help each other solve problems.\n\nhmm should every product have a discord for ideasbugs calendly dialogos?

we forget we used to live in tribes of 150 etc..\n\nWhat do you think you need the most help with right now?

maybe a group discussion about it on the page for example\n\nshared trials with men, GREAT way to make friends.

etc\n\nhost live townhalls in the guam community when its up and running, after i nail the product, and market a bit.

look at community builders, vibes builders\n\nit really feels like found family, i take refuge in the longtermers haha.

built on curated group chats\n\ndo the 908 coliving storytelling night to see where were all from and family from back home.

idk if thats worth the cost\n\nhow do i foster community around me, my personal brand, and a community behind every product.

just so i dont feel social whiplash all the time\n\nalso create just a general chat for the community to chat, local-based chats.

maybe a group discussion about it on the page for example\n\nbe visible about the club too: on IG and also hand select people from coding meetup and soccer and mmxx FD.

my "big 5"\n\nso cool to see families here\n\nwe should have an indiehacking mini community.\n\nbuild a tribe of peers, not 1 sided audiences..\n\ncommunity is very important.

just the making friends online, feeling the "first day of school feeling" finding self-selected mentally aligned people: young FANs, thats most of the value already, arguably.

group dinners lol\n\nalso since each party/club is a community around a single commandment, you can have meetups and curated shit chain chat group chats around poker, soccer, philosophy, etc.

well nail it then scale it\n\nim trying to bring together people on island to collab and trade tips along these 3 life pillars.\n\nfor every mosaic vector slice, join/build an ns community for it.

vibe attracts tribe\n\nphysical instantiations of digital communities are so cool.\n\nask 1517 how the dropout community can meet irl, make real friends\n\nfor every mosaic vector slice, join/build an ns community for it.

group chats cool* idk\n\nfind other philosophers, indiehackers, biohackers, musical peeps, soccer peeps online and befriend them, be a brother to them\n\nhmm should every product have a discord for ideasbugs calendly dialogos?

every user can talk to users in their vicinity\n\nfind other philosophers, indiehackers, biohackers, musical peeps, soccer peeps online and befriend them, be a brother to them\n\nsend cal link to all customers, AND all pod guests.

and learn from the last pods.\n\nside note: both find and build up the best people we can find on island that are into this stuff, the more people, the more incentive for guest speakers, etc, the more value\n\nsurrounded by friends..

make sure all the kinks in the hose are dealt with and the value/water flows...\n\nalso since each party/club is a community around a single commandment, you can have meetups and curated shit chain chat group chats around poker, soccer, philosophy, etc.

well nail it then scale it\n\nsolving loneliness with community and conversations and self improvement and creative expression\n\nim trying to bring together people on island to collab and trade tips along these 3 life pillars.\n\ndo weekly hangout calls for my X audience.

Being a lone doing this is hard, very small population - very hard to find people who are ambitious / “like me” / “nerdy” people\n\npeople come for diff motivations: fitness, the social life for nerds, the earning, people leave for diff motivations: life elsewhere already established and just visiting/exploring.
