long form.

start shittily.

when do you stop?

10 friends or so???

interesting people.

2x2: accurate, slow.

yeah that makes sense.

make sure the mission matters.

ask them about things they care about.

have some bullet points to talk about.

i guess balaji and donovan are just correcting an error.

leaders dont expect subordinates to do what they wouldnt do for the mission.

tell them about me point to my new blog tell em what im looking to talk about what i like about you xyz.

how do you solve the asshole problem though, and keep people out that shouldnt be there?\n\nlead by example.

markets select for benevolent dictators, like LKY, elon, jobs


1,1,make a list of people that i wanna talk to.

recreating stanford palo alto sf, "silicon valley without wokeness"\n\nlky was like the godfather, he was like an ethical marlon brando or al pacino\n\nsometimes you gotta be a pragmatic leader like that samurai leader from wano, look foolish but the next century will thank you\n\n

blind spots, fast\n\nmaybe good leadership heuristic: dont have someone do something that you wouldnt do, if you were them\n\nthe intelligence of the founder should make you feel dumb, should energize you, should be morally bound.\n\nelon only micromanages the #1 problem of each of his companies, he removes the 1 influential/reccuring bottleneck\n\nfind the people that are ALREADY great, AND cultivate people that have the right attitude and can be built up.
