lol.

it feels like apple after steve jobs left or something

i like lee kuan yew, hes not perfect, but who the fuck is?

hes pretty admirable as a nation builder

when i went to singapore, i just nerded out on him

im going there for a couple conferences soon: dont die summit + the network state conference

hopefully i get into the network school too.

ive felt like dark talent

the dont die summit is by bryan johnson, the guy thats trying to live forever

the first real reason i wanted to go the network state conference is because i see the value in a code-style regulatory structure, especially when it comes to nuclear, a foundationally important tech

and a lot of my heroes go through singapore, its a pretty cool place with good values.
