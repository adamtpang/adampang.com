then just repeat...

I like to say to myself: generate, curate, excavate.

this means to just create, then sift through / edit what you made, then execute on what's left.

whatever is salient to me / whatever excites me to write about / talk about

you can expect this blog to start messy, and ill clean it up along the way, and expand on topics i deem worthy

i think carl jung used to just have people ramble and talk about whatever comes to mind, and then he started to notice patterns in topic, that's kinda my strategy for this blog, at least initially.
