memes on genes.

like edo period.

variation and selection.

we cant mate with chimps.

homo sapiens

creation and curation.

genes and memes\n\nvariation, selection.

humanity is on its own when it comes to species.

darwinian evolution theory is a "good enough" system.

we have a genetic evolution layer, and a memetic evolution layer.

darwin ethics + psychology\n\n

we run evolution's OS on evolution.

+ empathy is OS emulation within an OS\n\nmentally, humans can become new species.

its like peace and war times, when tons of thoughts have to die, plasticity rises, new patterns are picked up.

explore and exploit modes oscillate

its pretty crazy how species branch off from one another with time and deviation.

variation and selection shape the superorganism (species and all of life)

this is like what vervaeke and peterson talk about with agent-arena fittedness.

the software can change while the hardware stays the same\n\ngenetics are the weights and biases of time through evolution being the algo\n\ni should be able to write a blog post that combines 2 or more blog post topics: darwin evolution + ethics.

its so cool because life does this: mosquitos birth tons of babies (variation), and tons die (selection) (a stress test)

this is like what happens in our brain "our thoughts die so we dont have to"

not only are humans like those mosquitos, but we also have that going on in our heads.
