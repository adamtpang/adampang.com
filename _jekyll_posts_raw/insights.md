what returns is deept.

i was and am learning but ive reached a threshold youll see.

flow, transformative truths

remember that magnets both attract and repel.

what repeats is deep.\n\nmama just doesnt want me home without results to show for it.

my mental scaffolding has upgraded with insight cascades\n\nwhen my bedrock is levered, and theres more under the hood in life than i thought, i live for those moments, when i get an insight cascade and life has to be recontextualized and compressed in many ways\n\n

lukewarm safety is unnatractive, its not bold and its unimaginative

pain is plasticity, youre brain is then primed for picking up on the right pattern/s



people that cheer me up: sivers, kagan, sometimes ferriss

partial truthsll get ya, and lead you down incomplete roads

experience married to insight\n\nthe whole point is to figure out transformative truths, insights that change your behavior in a positive way, snd you flow and enjoy life, getting unstuck, unblocked..\n\nwhen my bedrock is levered, and theres more under the hood in life than i thought, i live for those moments, when i get an insight cascade and life has to be recontextualized and compressed in many ways\n\nwrite about how you can have a major aha moment / insight cascade, but since your brain doesn't hold it all at once, plus it auto-forgets, sometimes you gotta reremember past insights.
