more families, more kids, idk, what makes an s tier society, how do we work from where we are, what we have, and get to where we need to be?

like an etf of values\n\nusa still stands a chance against china if it can get its governance right, and maybe fork the nation red and blue?

Here's a first pass: “In a time of collapsing trust, censorship, broken education, and economic dead ends, a group of rebels left the system.

+the fame post + cowardice post.\n\nfigure out the network society stampable template thing for v5, the open source guide to bootstrapping your own.

also re: crypto conditional visibility will be crazy, like rinstas, finstas, close friends, etc.)\n\nwe are collectively writing the newest testemant.

my life priorities are life, ns, money, love, creativity\n\n3/4 top monthly burn problems can be solved by NS andor townhall solving those guam issues.

both within you and in society?\n\nit does not break physics, the only things you need are problem awareness, understanding, and action\n\ncitizen scientists are cool.

i like having public and private backups of each other, more resilient society that way\n\ntownhall should take local surveys like the chines to help inform governemnt.

this will feed into our prioritization ai based on how many times something like this has been said, and who says it, will be bucketed with categorization, and solved..

solve problems and help solve problems.\n\nhow can we optimize the internet / social media for connection, and not just content consumption\n\nwe need equal gender ratio.

and you also want max utility FOR YOU, even if youre not the one doing it..\n\nmake sure to stay, recruit, and most of all after the bootcamp, contribute to the network society.

NS is a great idea\n\nif violence and coercion are immoral, then by inverse, life and wellbeing and anti-coercion / freeing, is moral!\n\nfight the narcisissm and self-obsession.

people dont control where they spawn, but we all play this game of life, and we obviously are handed different cards in life, but we should have freedom of opportunity for all no?

so i can safely be an indiehacker for example, like athletes\n\nin townhall, prove to people that it can work with lots of little bounties and plans, then we can ramp up the scale.

its a lack of founders understanding investment and regulation that makes business unhospitable\n\nwow lky said democracy does not change gov without viiolence, but in terms of effeciency it clearly lacks.

and by teaching you also may find holes in your logic, which is good, because thats an opportunity to reconcile that, where before you were living more blind.\n\n1 8020 step for townhall.town and share to ns.
