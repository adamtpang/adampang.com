science is knowledge generation, technology is science applied, engineering is the process of applying science, mathematics is the underlying order of it all\n\nbro im excited to max out my neurons at 25 apparently.

focus on the best atom-problems first: energy gas manufacturing (advanced and housing)

OH MY FUCKING GOD: star farms (nuclear or solar), connect to sabatier machines and bitcoin mining rigs (sucks up all the volatility).

but you suddenly become rare IF you combine software and hardware skills AND you need to make sure that those skills are useful to s tier missions, meaning teams that are working on solutions that solve major problems, AND you must own a piece of that solution, so you can earn non-linearly.

build capital, make plans, buy from china, build out in permissionless land to show results and convince by example\n\ni fuckin love vector sum analogy: works for meaning, goals, values, progress, its fully encompassing sorta and its a visual concept like math is so it goes into my gpu lol.
