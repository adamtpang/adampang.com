i can write about deep tech still, i dont like the david goggins thing, ive tried it.

the combinatorics, and economics

im disciplined diligent sorta lazy, and disciplined.

being courageous

talking or learning without action is cowardice

do what scares you.

dont do unnecessary stuffs but when something you know you gotta do, and can do, do it.

i guess whatever comes to mind, i can always curate later

X respected person said that.

even if something is hard, if it energizes me, go do that

who are your mentors' mentors?

level up, ill like myself more, better for friends and relationships, no more debt stress.

my current life philosophy: death is a 1 way door, so lets see what we can do in this life.

what ive learned about addiction

what comes easy to me is talking a lot and asking a lot of questions.

you can trust what is stress-tested

become sharp so you can be powerful AND good

but does it resonate?

you need thinking and action, but one does not substitute for the othher


boils down to time and energy.

i need to talk online and meet people online to satisfy this need for expression

use sift.best and caldump.

just continuously learn in free markets

go through life story and what i learned from each inflection point.

code media energy gas manufacturing

dont get trapped in local minima, its the meta game that really matters.

https://ana.sh/

why am i doing this?

i dont have to be well known but can be known well

fullstack human

i learned hard lessons by trying music and trying tech.

im just gonna ramble, then ill consolidate, then ill clean up thoughts, itll get better and better but at least im starting.

is a great question to just map out what's going on with your life

challenge skills balance:


clear goals: code and media
why?

experiment, fearset

say that i respond to anyone reasonable, id love to hear what you think about anything ive said, dont be shy!

think about the long game

traits i admire in others: not take themselves so seriously, love noah kagan and tim ferriss about that.

i can leave Guam

validation from results from action from smallness

talk is cheap, actions and reality stress test your thoughts.

then surround yourself with people who also want that pie, then grow the pie together

just being myself, always trying to improve.

music: i learned that people pay for value
tech: i learned about supply and demand and skill stacking

just learn, follow curiosity.

top 2

build things thatd be valuable to you, and as you expand, the list of things thatd be valuable to you EXPANDS

what is salient?

if i code and blog and podcast and hardware manufacturing and music and philosophy and sports, will i be the best in the world at THAT?

leverage is like with greater power comes greater responsibility

coding your life algo for the right outcomes you want

the startup of you.

someones music, the books they read, the people they follow on X, what they watch on youtube, says a lot, their favorite movies

vice signalling.

when people are crazier, more famous, they basically create room for you to be just less crazy, famous, wihtout being the first target for scapegoating.

link to things like ABOUT if they dont know about me, heres the breakdown of expenses and what i learned from each, why i went, my heroes, why i like them etc.

self-deprecation sometimes idk

idk if it was jung but i think he would have his patients just ramble, then patterns would emerge, same thing im trying with the blog.

talk about being from guam and its career challenges, maybe its a good constraint because i really focus on code and media because of it

noah kagan gots great energy.

stand the test of time, the serious people will still be here after years, if they have the endurace inheritly aligned with their nature

do not be the best, be the only.

find the gaps in the world that you uniquely can create, leverage, and own

if youre cool, ill invite you into my life, and im working on bettering my life too

i like pragmatism.

falling short of a goal because of lack of knowledge or skill, both of which can be bettered

continuous learners in free markete yo

clear conscience priceless

if not this, then what?

can see the good and bad before them

only ask of people what youd do OR if they actually like to do it

be the best in the world at what you do, keep redefining yourself until this is true.

include year and age

i wanna be an open book, idk it just feels right, so ill share stuff even if its embarassing or


add lky and what i learned from him

what do i even start talking about?

i like them, their controversial to some, i like the boldness, im not easily bothered, i like them for other reasons, i see why they bother people but i still admire certain dimensions of them.

its the orchestration

if people are jumping off the cliff, but theres good reason to think that theres actually something better off the cliff, ill look off the cliff, and when i see it, ill jump.

specify whats DIFFERENT with each idea and whats the SAME\n\ntell people its in constant development, maybe make a github repo tracker thing that says last updated x days ago, put its in alpha stage.

put an ideasbugs little form.\n\nhave internal docs to myself with functions like stripe and firebase, stuff that repeats when i do this process, and maybe add to boilerfork with some readme for functions.

upskilling

life formulas/equations

why is your only reference other people whove done xyz, you gotta think 1st principles and derive Godly solutions to Devilish problems

the goal is input and output DISCONNECTED.

openness: just follow curiosity
conscientiousness: elon algo

validation from results from action from clarity from articulation from

if you create the outline of the puzzle, the missing piece becomes clear

when does honesty go wrong?

obviously combine the 3 codes in 1 website soon then delete the codebases and railway and vercel and shit\n\ntell people its in constant development, maybe make a github repo tracker thing that says last updated x days ago, put its in alpha stage.

mental frameworks must be stresstested against reality


talk about going to therapy, talking needs to be a compliment to action, not a substitute, from thiel's recent talk with joe rogan

good frameworks i learnd

when i gots money, travel and shit???

i gotta do code and media

speed from clarity from knowledge from experimentation from courage

the most contrarian thing of all is to think for yourself, not oppose the crowd

these tiny twitter and blog experiments build my confidence for bigger experiments like podcasting

i wanna be systematic with my life.

deutschian knowledge and action

life is trades

when you learn the fundamentals of a system, you can rederive solutions from the ground up
