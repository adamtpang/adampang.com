it is like im just regurgiating the beginning of infinity knowledge, but i mean, its genuinely interesting, i do want to live from that "spirit" of play, curiosity, strength, upskilling, "leveling up" if you will.

find the real value in the hype, destroy the idea as much as you can, and if it stands, you can trust\n\nwhen you steelman, often you can see both sides, then nuance comes into play\n\nboils down to time and energy.

i could be wrong but i think ive learned\n\ni like the ideas of bjorn lomberg, but it seems to me that you cant change the shape of the power law, BUT you can raise the ceiling, or the floor, but the shape wont change.

use their og rating of top 500 100 whatever and its a fresh count\n\nmaybe i should also write blog posts about why i made each startup like a tiny white paper, put alongside the other great companies and how theyd look on paper.

i want a sweet spot of market postiion when it comes to attention.\n\nin hower def show the count and percentage from starting amount (last import) ask if they wanna add on top from clipboard or a whole new addition to working db.

importance approach of the Eisenhower Matrix 3.\n\nwith math i see the really real more clearly, and there are so many good math analogies its actually arguably the best place to find mental models because its actually the models of reality.

Since verified accounts often have higher visibility and interaction, this could skew PageRank scores, potentially overvaluing or undervaluing certain accounts based on their verification status rather than true influence or content quality.

However, it would need careful implementation to balance between offering insightful connections and avoiding the pitfalls of oversimplification and privacy invasion.\n\nwhich people and books take most mindshare of your mind?: for me the 5 heroes.

maybe time is the wrong frame too idk\n\nAnd like jungian pattern recognition rambling used to do, you can just do a bunch of stuff, aiming for quantity, volume, and then you can purposely do that, and then look back and then edit, curate, critique.

Monetization Strategy: X might see this as an opportunity or threat to its monetization strategy, particularly if the analysis shows how verified accounts drive engagement or if it highlights any systemic biases introduced by the verification system.

This alignment could be weighted by interaction (how often users engage with similar content) or explicit user feedback.\n\nComplexity: Ideological positions are complex and dynamic; reducing them to points in space might oversimplify nuanced beliefs.

which mag does it lie in?\n\ninvestment shouldnt be exactly about noticing upward trend of investment, like a stock price, it should be about conviction and substance and explanatory conviction in your explanatory mental scaffolding\n\nsalience guides me.

Well it depends on the problem at hand, just do your best at every given moment, just like explanations and the more sure less sure axioms / conjectures that make them up mechanistically, it can forever be evolving to whatever life needs at a time.\n\nwoah.

like for me i seem to be best as a short defender so i should study verratti\n\nInfluence Mapping: For marketers or analysts, understanding the network of influence among verified accounts could be valuable for strategic engagements or influencer marketing.
