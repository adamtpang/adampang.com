just get started.

faster batch processing

what does code look like?

make the batch script convert any link to its markdown equivalent.

do bubble sort first, then get to quicksort.

fix the spacing and line breaks\n\nconstants to variables\n\nknow in practice not just theory.

only go deep when the gist doesnt cut it

aim for speed and volume at first, let the perfectionist in late\n\njust like in code, use the most abstracted functions and languages, as is reasonable.

if you cant program it you dont understand it\n\nbeing able to program is not enough\n\ncode in english..\n\nwhen debugging, log.\n\ncode all forms media.

fix the spacing and line breaks

make it so that if the directory already exists, dont do anything, if there is no md for an existing directory, delete it.

only chovin and hilton 1 and 2\n\nwrite code once, run it forever and how many times you wanna subroutine\n\nlearning the language of computers is akin to learning English as the lingua franca.\n\njust like in code, use the most abstracted functions and languages, as is reasonable.

although is increasingly the lingua franca of humans AND computers.\n\nwrite code once, run it forever and how many times you wanna subroutine\n\n
