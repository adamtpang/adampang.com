it only counts if it costs

the 4d world plays out in 3d, the 5d world plays out in time

i grew up in Christianity, after exploring other religions, i still like Christianity the most

i feel so conflicted.

siddartha...\n\n"if you can quantify it, its not sacred." "the spiritiual is non mental non physical"\n\n~ look to the first and last commandments: look only to God, do not mimetically look around.\n\nfollow the light.

a new 3rd way, not athiest, not classicaly religious, a third way, the new age\n\nonce you stop taking the concept of God too literally, it's not a guy in the sky, all the religious language just makes so much more sense.

i think because its non dogmatic and science compatible, unlike dogmatic religions\n\nlots of sufferers of scientism are saved by science fiction because its the overlap between science and the spiritual\n\nempower yourself.

the people that are and feel most "clear" both radiate and let through, the light.\n\ni was taught that sex is evil my whole life w dad and catholicism but its really a beautiful moral thing\n\ni notice buddhism is spreading.

a new 3rd way, not athiest, not classicaly religious, a third way, the new age\n\nsubstance not time, the best youtube videos for example come from tons of years of production, its about the quality not the time of production.

every obstacle is an opportunity for virtue\n\nSo I started to have a journey back to religion, but from a different angle.\n\nalso we can reconcile pagan and christian paradigms: be both powerful and good\n\nbuddhist views through a catholic lens.

it only counts if it costs\n\n~ Right View, Right Resolve, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration.\n\nas long as you reach the a-s tier, no need to worry about rank if you fall into the good bucket.

well i think the vague point is more important than an explanation

unwavering unconditional love is the way out of the mimetic process

should be a daily bible like daily stoic, accessible


do not look around to others, only up to God - thiel

Christ exposed our sins.

the first line in the dao de jing is the dao that can be spoken of is not the true dao..\n\nlove is seeing the interconnectedness of all, seeing source\n\nalso we can reconcile pagan and christian paradigms: be both powerful and good\n\nbuddhist views through a catholic lens.

siddartha...\n\nwrite about infinite being, and reconciling pagan and christian paradigms, and reconciling science and religion\n\ni like how in buddhism, there was THE buddha yes, but being a buddha is a state of being, theres not just one thats possible, i like that.\n\nwrite about to and from religion.

the people that are and feel most "clear" both radiate and let through, the light.\n\nspirituality as nonmental nonphysical\n\nwrestle with God\n\nbathe in the love\n\nbeing gay with the boys >>>\n\nmusic is spiritual medicine\n\nWrite about “to and from religion”\n\nyour conscience is the voice of God\n\nwe are manifestations of the spirit.\n\nspirituality as nonmental nonphysical\n\nyou are a manifestation, not the spirit\n\npass karma from today to tomorrow's life\n\nspiritual means: not mental not physical.\n\ngive awesome people awesome opportunities\n\ndo not look around to others, only up to God\n\nbe solo in nature like jesus, buddha, mystics\n\n- do not look around to others only up to God\n\nbelief comes before ability.
