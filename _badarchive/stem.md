remember 9010 rule\n\nspeed volume curationarsolutions should have graphs with deaths averted or deaths allowed because xyz DIDNT happen.

write this ebook idk.\n\nwere all on the same team, some are starters some on bench, reserves, academy\n\nknow in practice not just theory.

have the capability with tech to keep up with demand of these foundational things like energy, housing, gas\n\nmaybe just do cnc machining.

but how do they differentiate.\n\nso i know software a fair bit, i eventually wanna learn hardware but its very capital intensive to learn.

for me: tons of solar and nuclear projects * sabatier machines = super cheap gas and energy, THEN we 100x manufacturing with factorio-style.

i mean i can learn hardware but i feel like id have to go to advanced manufacturing first since the scaling part is uber suck, like elon said.

i mean i can learn hardware but i feel like id have to go to advanced manufacturing first since the scaling part is uber suck, like elon said.

empower yourself with permissionless leverage for example, learn the timeless explanations: the great books, math, programming, physics (STEM).

but math alone is knowledge, cs and physics (engineering) can APPLY it\n\nas a dropout, if i were to go to traditional college, what major would i pick?

at least id think so\n\nif you code, practice math, because itll come in handy when/if software is maxxed in our lifetimes and we transition to more physics.

After you specify the best problems to work on, and zero in on a few/one, ask yourself what are the best solutions and its constituent parts for its timeline.

knowledge, life, art, creativity\n\ni can be like elon and transition to energy gas manufacturing (advanced and housing)\n\norder of operations is so important.
