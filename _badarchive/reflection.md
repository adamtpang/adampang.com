for me?

what am i to make of this circumstance?

i mean a lot of people that will see this i know irl, i don't know.

but what is the difference between private notes to self vs notes you share with others?

idk..\n\nthere will be a "protect the ball" power law directive for:\n\nwhat do i rarely regret?

reflection on why is always available\n\ni've been struggling when it comes to knowing what to write.

i know i want to write and continue this thread to get to the 100 day mark, but who am i writing for?

taking notes, talking to self, being in silence\n\ngood shit you didnt have your phone and you just talked to yourself and verbally untangled\n\n

check previous personal site and what i wrote then

i keep thinking of the people that didnt show up\n\nyour best guess is always available to you.
