hybrid approach?

liver supplement.

how else?\n\n**5.

is ideology ever good?

thats it\n\nblood work.

ddrink the coolaid haha.

etc insert so much more.

we cant mate with chimps.

we cant mate with chimps.

we cant mate with chimps.

ideology becomes biology.

into the tapestry of life?

file this under awe insights.

it can be for better or worse.

thoughts die so we dont have to.

thoughts die so we dont have to.

evolution is deviation selection.

evolution is deviation selection.

evolution is deviation selection.

we should make koolaid at ns lol.

homo sapiens

is violence curation?

we literally weave dna together no?

you sow specifically, reap generally.

they overlap,\n\nideology/values repo.

blood donation\n\nbiotech to grow taller..

how do you not get trapped in an ideology?

humanity is on its own when it comes to species.

humanity is on its own when it comes to species.

humanity is on its own when it comes to species.

solve shortness lol\n\ncan genes be edited live?

emergent properties gotta be a wonder of the world.

theres a thought repo, landscape, and genetic repo.

theres a thought repo, landscape, and genetic repo.

das why i eat broccoli lol\n\nthey call it chemistry.

talk about the living chain from the first life forms to us.

just look at the koreas at night.\n\nreconcile God and gods.

we need irl because kids (ideology to biology tied)\n\ncults.

i guess what makes it good or bad is if it works for you idk.

maybe thats why the anima animus, ying yang has an 8020 split.

maybe thats why the anima animus, ying yang has an 8020 split.

how do you judge if something is better or worse, you compare?

i like genetics, go into that\n\ni can also bioprint my 3+ kids?

one size does not fit all, but all sizes fits all, thats what i like about ns.

and i also dont like how i feel like im selling ns to people, and its all good.

its not a virus, but it does take hold of the minds it possesses, like a spirit.

make the macros gptmd balaji kian app..\n\nideology and biology have been decoupled.

is violence needed for curation or is mere economics a good enough curator of genetics?

is violence needed for curation or is mere economics a good enough curator of genetics?

lol\n\nyou cant bee without the hive.\n\ndiff genetics, diff diet needed?\n\nmore oysters.

its crazy\n\nincrease T reduce Cortisol reduce microplastics with that rhonda patrick tip.

women like sex\n\nlook into gene editing, is it pre birth only or is all also possible post birth?

variation and selection\n\nuse ayn rand laissez fair free market capitalism to solve our problems.

maybe thats why the anima animus, ying yang has an 8020 split.\n\nevolution is deviation selection.

its our time, you are a part of this huge thing called life

pain is plasticity

is violence curation?

we need irl because kids (ideology to biology tied)\n\nfor capitalism haters: do you know how to build a car?

thats literally males females

its pretty crazy how species branch off from one another with time and deviation.

its not, but the team knows that, its not a panacea, its always in flux, always improveable, just like any of us.

homo sapiens

think about you, then your parents, and then their parents, all the way back to the first liforms on earth.

mind and body...\n\nvariation and selection shape the superorganism (species and all of life)\n\ngenetics testing, blood work etc.

or only prebirth?\n\nwe are all self defending self-replicators.\n\nmaximize atp mitochondria via lifestyle diet\n\nsteak bone broth.

thats literally males females

superorganism w adam pangelinan

its pretty crazy how species branch off from one another with time and deviation.

also look at alternatives like communism, its never worked, its killed people, and also it prevented new life from blossoming thats such a tragedy.

generation (male), selection (females), is how the humanity superorganism


height

our genes go through male and female manifestations through time.

thats literally males females\n\nsuperorganism w adam pangelinan\n\nits pretty crazy how species branch off from one another with time and deviation.

thats the 3rd commandment, thats an ideological defense against other ideologies, thats why ideologies are sticky, they also defend against other ones.

thats literally males females

superorganism w adam pangelinan

generation (male), selection (females), is how the humanity superorganism

is violence curation?

homo sapiens\n\nhumanity is like a superorganisms\n\nthink about you, then your parents, and then their parents, all the way back to the first liforms on earth.

what an image\n\njust because you replicate doesnt mean you have wuality or longevity, thats the trifecta: quantity quality longevity of kids.\n\nideology/values repo.

sex and kids have been decoupled\n\nits so cool how the superorganism works on diff things all in concert like an orchestra\n\nevery hub is a mecca for an ideological vector.

Darwinian baldwin effect?\n\ntestosterone markers, best biomarkers, genetics, etc\n\nMortality == longevity, health, telomeres, stem cells\n\nmicroplastics and testosterone test.

collogan\n\ncell to human to superorganism to life itself\n\ngenetics startup with bts dna as the music lol\n\nis the fertility crisis a genetic "correction"?\n\nThe big 5 correlations.

measure and solve\n\nnervous system: sleep, relationships, therapy is loaning\n\njust as dormant genes (JP laden), dormant people in gene pool\n\nimagine when we can bioprint humans etc.

figure this out\n\nwhen idelogy and biology dovetail, baldwin effect, gene and meme venn diagram fusion + dbz fusion.\n\nthere is value in wandering, then focus, this is how genes and memes work.

straight to adulthood.\n\ndarwinian ethics is based around life death and quality of life\n\nso the parent can choose variants that they want, sperm and egg shit\n\nideology and biology coallesce with the baldwin effect.

and genetic editing them pre and post birth?\n\nIts fun to look at siblings and to see what is dna vs what is the particulars of the person..\n\nwomen WANT an awesome s tier best tier of complementary man to cum in them lol.

minimum effective governance.\n\ngeneral adaptation to the meta-game, ecology of practices-species for life adaptation, non-extinction.\n\nstate and psychological predisposition and gut microbiome affects political and career stuff.

is violence needed for curation or is mere economics a good enough curator of genetics?\n\ngeneration (male), selection (females), is how the humanity superorganism\n\nour genes go through male and female manifestations through time.

its our time, you are a part of this huge thing called life\n\nwhat does the superorganism need?\n\nwrite about genetics, ethics, gattaca\n\nglycine and collagen\n\nbeef liver :) GET THIS\n\negg yolks are also good\n\nmeat honey water.

our ancestors got this far, its our turn to hold the candle and not let the candle of life go out

generation (male), selection (females), is how the humanity superorganism

our genes go through male and female manifestations through time.

Cultural and Ideological Alignment: Challenge: People's willingness to align with a network state based on ideology rather than geography requires a significant cultural shift, which is currently not widespread enough to materialize the concept fully.

Sources: Srinivasan's discussions on the shift from geographical to ideological communities are central to his vision but face practical challenges in real-world application.\n\n

sex and kids have been decoupled\n\nget dna test from nucleus, then try blood work for T levels and check lead or **\n\ngreat synergistic programming areas: hardware and genetics.

"livers of the sea"\n\ndo microplastics and genetics test\n\nboobs are the fruit of the body lol\n\nkeep bees, get some raw honey manuka?\n\ngenes and ideas vary and merge to main\n\nget lactose tolerant and get more milk\n\nideology and biology will coalesce again\n\nsolve power law death like heart disease\n\nwrite about getting more neurons till 25.\n\nbiotech to get taller.

"cast the first stone" line, look in the mirror first before critiquing\n\na mothers milk is to a fathers seed real life yin ynag\n\nresults and taste/preference are the ideological antibodies\n\narjun khemani is the lamine yamal of technooptimism (new religion?)\n\nmen need womenâ€™s humans and potions (sex/children and nourishment/healing)\n\nideology and biology have been decoupled.

made the pilgrimage to ns at forest city\n\ncertain ideologies are more violent toward other ideologies than others, i think the danger tierlist is like:\n\nall evils come from lack of knowledge, like communism, it seems good but maybe they havent considered the koreas etc\n\ngenerate curate elevate, its how evolution works, how the mind works, how creativity works, how explanations work.
