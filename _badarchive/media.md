its preselection, its fame\n\ninterview people i think are interesting.

i want to have a high bar for new and existing tweets, a creative menu.

fame preselection\n\nwho im with: gotta generate more with the internet.

balaji\n\ndont get trapped in local minima, its the meta game that really matters.

blog posts, training an ai on my voice and doing audio essays, posting to youtube.

cant go wrong with permissionless media and code leverage.\n\npods dont HAVE to be from x.

on Jan 28, 2025 at 8:00 PM - 8:30 PM\n\nwho im with: gotta generate more with the internet.

ai visuals that are relevant\n\n"building relationships at scale" what does that look like?

these are content upgrades, standardized: text -> pic -> mp3 -> mp4\n\nblogs before podcast.

i learned by doing, i wouldnt of knowndoes everyone who is famous get death threats and stuff?

twitter all that media shit\n\ndo 1 pod recording w people here at ns, tier list the directory.

check naval and balaji about media leverage\n\nwhat is the META problem, of your top 3 problems?

orchestrate each: IG, blogs, podcast, youtube, spotify, tXitter\n\ntwitter is like a newsletter.

solve fame for me and others, solve the attention economy, eyeballs, and it will knock both out.

what if i just kept doing philosophy videos and that will solve debt and sexlessness, just that.

make solo clips 1 minute, and now also post 10 minute segments from full podcast episodes.\n\nhmm.

actually thats why its better to record a private non-live public conversation, so no walls are up.

i should put emojis in title.\n\n“rubberband name” or “blueblockers” health conscious conservatives.

both standalone and relates to other blog posts and other internet links\n\nmusic is also media leverage.

remember to have broadcast 1-way on the internet, AND invite a 2-way permissioned engagement, a community.

remember to have broadcast 1-way on the internet, AND invite a 2-way permissioned engagement, a community.

orchestrate each: IG, blogs, podcast, youtube, spotify, tXitter

i learned: make IG stories landscape instead.

gpt it

linkedin update:
under construction

at least ill be honest on linkedin

twitter is like a newsletter.

thread with naval's post\n\noh you can have different resolutions on the internet, with different audience access.

i want some to be highlighted and broadcast, other things to be optional to read\n\nupload the pod clips to youtube?

its basically all good things till that point huh?\n\nfame through visible competence and permissionless media leverage.

i want different feeds so people can sign up to the glass they want from me, not the whole mosaic\n\ni gotta tweet more.

soundcloud will be more experimental, spotify is where the cream and polish go..\n\nto solve the smart people are starved.

100 apps 100 pods 100 clips 1000 posts 10000 posts.\n\nthe merit of podcasts is showcasing gems THAT DONT PUBLISH THEMSELVES.

above or below the api\n\nmedia leverage is like im making 500 mini mes that talk\n\npost more media, pics videos, links, etc.

idk\n\nwrite about companies influencers and big subreddits, once ns is proven and easily onboarxavle\n\nalso post on youtube.

where else?\n\nevery blog is said in airchat and exported to youtube and spotify sivers style naval style\n\nfame is like an inbox.

post the vervaeke reply to gigi regarding meaning, then stitch the link to her reply..\n\nstamp my face on new videos and podcasts.

balaji\n\nso post on spotify, youtube, twitter, through anchor/spotify podcasters?\n\nstart a minimalist podcast, like danny miranda.

have a discord a telegram a whatsapp a calendly a podcast inviter an airchat bubble\n\nstart a minimalist podcast, like danny miranda.

just make the titles first then get drafting rate how complete / formed i think i articulated my intention\n\nmake 100 short form videos, clips.

then archive the poor ratio ones for a while, then find a way to release without notifying\n\n1,1,do the living doc meta doc for my blog / essays.

i think ferriss' mags (7+) and his KIND of audience (desperate?) make for a bad recipe for him, but hes been able to pseudosolve it\n\ni gotta start a pod.

something where less road jiggle, and easy to mount, and a good pov for my face on Feb 6, 2025 at 12:30 noon - 1:00 PM\n\ntry podcasting with my fav youtubers.

i want some to be highlighted and broadcast, other things to be optional to read

make it TXitter

talk about the best of the twitter experiment, twitter curate.

parse ig twitter linkedin

share that writing is the basis for other media, like a screenplay to film

"building relationships at scale" what does that look like?

what else or coming up media\n\nyew jawaani hai deewani download this film, parse my downloaded films\n\npermissionless leverage media leverage and 2 way invites.

parse ig twitter linkedin


analogize to a dunbar village tmi online

young people on twitter i think are going somewhere: luke farritor, aydin gokce

why not twitter?

i dont want to force feed info to people

reach out to twitter ig linkedin txitter

"tXitter"

so post on spotify, youtube, twitter, through anchor/spotify podcasters?

check stoicism on this\n\nhave a visual style like tim ferriss in how he cartoonizes his guests' photos, or how lex fridman does photoshoots for his guests in hero poses.

what topics, who comes to mind, and who are the side characters that i could pull?\n\nmy posts will get more nuanced over time, itll get cleaned up, noise will turn to signal.

postbridge?\n\ncontent is still leverage, its like people get to sit in on your conversation youd wanna have anyway with someone\n\nmake audio and video essays like sivers does.

so a new skill emerges: curating\n\nI mean I learned from naval that code and media are permissionless leverage, so I'm doin it\n\n"project your voice" ok so i dont wanna change?

10 1 minutes = 1 10 minute.\n\nmedia is for leverage but also to let like minded people find me instead of just me finding MEs\n\nput relevant background images on pod clips/reels.

so grateful for the internet.\n\nevery blog is said in airchat and exported to youtube and spotify sivers style naval style\n\n"twitter is a dumpster fire" well make it not that lol.

https://www.perplexity.ai/search/way-to-post-to-youtube-tiktok-r48G3cdJQr2M8Kzupngebw https://www.post-bridge.com/\n\nstarting a media company that solves a top problem is a meta move.

curation is thoughtful and useful

twitter game

so many people show themselves online and they dont die

if "nEt WoRtH is NeT WoRtH" then podcast blog youtube spotify tXitter is a way.

great for pithy things, the blog can be for more indepth riffing\n\ninstagram has a tilt, txitter has a tilt, both for different kinds of content and therefore attention metrics are different.

there is a lot to be learned in the dumpster\n\nmaybe media and friendship will make wealth and sex creation easier maybe its the influential first step\n\nlegacy media and clickbait are funny.

on Feb 5, 2025 at 12:30 noon - 1:00 PM\n\nMaybe each topic should preface what kinds of essays this folder topic will broadly cover, what its about.\n\nIG is also building relationships at scale.

digesting new feeds\n\nfantano productized himself: the internet's busiest music nerd\n\njedcal is 5 mags, hes got code and media leverage going for him:\n\nim tech philosophy music soccer adept.

talk about the tribal 150 dunbar number example

i dont want to tweet as much as i do blog, because tweeting is like shoving words down someones throat, its forced into their feed, let it be optional.

its alright.\n\n“the content of the new mediums is the content of the old mediums”\n\nmedia: blog, youtube, tiktok, twitter, email, book, spotify, podcast\n\noh yeah have more podcasts with girls too.

called "superorganism"

a podcast is like someone hearing in on our conversation

what are the forms of media?: blog, youtube, spotify, tXitter, instagram

you could say art is media too: music, film, etc

...

this is why i want an X export of following and followers app, and i can request certain metrics i guess into a google sheet.\n\nuntil you wake up to sales and notifications, you havent mastered code and media leverage.

imagine a world where this is possible, like cleo abram\n\nmake a book from most popular and most reposted x posts, a 1 page pdf summary of that account, well grok already does that\n\ncheck youtube and x and ig bookmarks.

have something that i can point to that will attract people and self select for those topics\n\nthere are other resources besides capital: labor, capital, code, media, energy, attention, understanding/knowledge\n\nyoutube channel.

have a discord a telegram a whatsapp a calendly a podcast inviter an airchat bubble\n\ngreat how the internet attention economy is pretty siloed, so you can safely gain "fame" good for sales for wealth creation and sexual opportunity.

“reports from the edge of the world”\n\nfor a lot of podcasts, the network effect, the power law is fueled by the viewership, and then it goes to people that want that attention, and its a cycle..\n\n100 pods 100 solo clips, 100 duo clips.

as long as we can see through the illusion we gots the antibodies well be fine\n\nthe attention economy is the only market im glad theres competition in, because being at the top of fame has serious downsides\n\nshare my tweets as stories too?

solving top problems with permissionless code and media leverage, with my specific knowledge, wrapped in accountability (face, voice, name, etc.)\n\nmake a newsletter for each topic tag people want to keep up\n\npassing by new songs seeing whatll stick.

media leverage\n\nso post on spotify, youtube, twitter, through anchor/spotify podcasters?\n\neach social media platform is like a diff country on the cloud continent\n\nshare that writing is the basis for other media, like a screenplay to film\n\ndescript desktop clips media leverage.

make a youtube channel and share tweetlike stuffs?make youtube videos like how i make twitter vids\n\nmedia leverage is just like if you were talking to people at scale, its no different than in person, ns teaches me this\n\nmake an ig reel company showcase, showing the problem they solve.

wealth.\n\nparasocial landscape post it\n\nmusic is also media leverage\n\n"enough LARPing can make it not a LARP"\n\n- 1 media rep (permission-less leverage)\n\nwe need to make "white mirror" content..\n\nthis is part of the "media" side of things\n\nautobots that turn life into media content..\n\nturn you labor capital code media.

youtube is visual, something i cant do in spotify, i can also link backlink the blog post to the youtube video to the spotify mini episode, each linked to each other.\n\n

multimedia posts\n\nmedia leverage is more for discoverability than fame per se\n\nput my podcast clips back on my instagram page, dont hide it\n\nmrbeast is media leverage.
