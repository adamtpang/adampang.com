your hard is my play.

my play is your hard.

trade makes us a superorganism.\n\nyou are already famous with the family and friends around you.

work on things that can last 100 years, that will matter without you being there, and do shit for that\n\n

work on infinite things that will live without you\n\nTerms of Use | Privacy Policy | Cookie Policy | Security Details\n\n"whatever you did not do in life, your children can pick up your baton â€¦"\n\nmake things that will last beyond you, where life is better because of its existence..\n\nreadinng and writing is hard.
