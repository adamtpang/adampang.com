keep going, let it be, dont force it but guide\n\nremember that women want a man, just like how you want a woman.

a man without a wife is but half a man on Apr 19, 2025 at 1:30 PM - 2:00 PM\n\npeople are the most important thing.

focus on reciprocal admiration peer relaitonships\n\nremember that women want a man, just like how you want a woman.

peer relationships\n\ndating apps distort perceptions away from reality\n\nif shes a gold digger, hes a beauty digger.

olena just gives love its crazy\n\nwealth solved, then visible competence and mutual attraction for kids and mating lol.

be around the wealth creators the friendship creators the girlfriendship creators\n\npractice the opposite of your big 5?

but i also havent had tigerwoods level tempations so...\n\nomg and value vectors are very important for male friendships.

this is a "on the horizon" thing\n\nmanage expectations with family and friends, no one person can give you all you need.

make that export categorization IG X tool\n\nminimum effective mag fame for what i want: girlfriend sex and online friends.

users, friends, mates, to yourself, etc.\n\ni want a feminine, good energy, hot, cute, smart, snarky girl, wifey material lol.

so have lots of great friends, lots of wealth, and stable plans for the future so they feel you wont lose either anytime soon.

context and preselection SUPER matters\n\ni think an honest relationship economy of beauty and resources is fine in the name of kids.

but he drains me, after funeral fade away from him\n\ncheck gabe castro, and crawl IG for guys with great girlfriends, like vance too?

every imperfection is repairable!\n\nrelationships are built on bids for attention, and those bids met\n\ndo i see infinity with this person?

for ig its visible competence to a girlfriend, its love relationship practice and i dont want kids rn cause my wealth and time isnt in order.

someone who can leave with you as you become a sovereign individual slowmad, with tradwife values*: ill build the walls, you build the garden.

so parse twitter following and followers to people ive dmed or something, or were spiritually\n\nwhat if you can be coparents but not partners?

traverse and grow the power law\n\nsometimes the people who like you you dont want them to like you, and the people that YOU like dont like you.

1000 true fans\n\nin long relationships the small things add up becuase of value calculus overlapping differences\n\nhave i outgrown this person?

under the hood, all relationships are economical, not saying that you should be heartless, every human deserves a base level of dignity and opportunity.

my work is in good shape, and my love is in mid shape, theyre tied\n\ni want a feminine, good energy, hot, cute, smart, snarky girl, wifey material lol.

under the hood, all relationships are economical, not saying that you should be heartless, every human deserves a base level of dignity and opportunity.

some people give less or more amounts of chances, depending on psychological predisposition\n\nkids take up so much time and energy but is so meaningful.

some people give less or more amounts of chances, depending on psychological predisposition\n\nkids take up so much time and energy but is so meaningful.

keep going, let it be, dont force it but guide\n\nmake a sexual marketplace elo leaderboard, just like forbes does for wealth, and dunedine does for health.

also where is the wisdom, sexual marketplace, and then meta pareto optimal leaderboards?\n\nyou shouldnt expect everything out of one person or place or thing.

make her feel good and shit etc\n\nbromances and romances lol: like 10x miguels and 0to1 and 10x amazing girlfriends\n\ni want to be known well not well known.

crazy fuckin thing just super changy phenomenon.\n\nalso fame is siloed, between spaces: philosophy, tech, athletics, sexual marketplace theory, wealth creation theory.

focus on reciprocal admiration peer relaitonships\n\npretty and smart and a good person and cares about making a great family takes it seriously thats some ethical shit.

who else?\n\nstart with your relationship with yourself, then males, then females, then girlfriends\n\nbeing able AND willing, to give her more than the other men in her life.

i want a pairbond i guess, or is it that i want what i can get, and what i can get im not satisfied with..\n\njust because you have A girlfriend doesnt mean its a good relationship.

i want more peer relationships not "followers"\n\ni want a girl with vibrant energy, accent, diff culture, very open, loving, supportive\n\nfinish one piece, thats my show with seb.

the most intimate..\n\nlet her initiate initiation, then match her energy, dont give her binary choices, then let it escalate naturally.\n\nim seeking friendship love, romantic love.

so diff setups do different things for each sex and whatever season of the marketplace it is..\n\nmanage expectations with family and friends, no one person can give you all you need.

no face recognition though, like sia\n\n~ “we like each other for the differences, not for more of the same.” youre not going to be friends with all guys, but you think all women will like you?

but he drains me, after funeral fade away from him\n\nsomeone whos a clean fighter SUPER SUPER great trait green flag in any long term relationship\n\nthe internet is great at 1-way relationships.

i want more peer relationships not "followers"\n\ni want a girlfriend for sex, intimacy, kids eventually, prove myself after prostitution\n\ngirls want a guy wholl give them attention and resources.

lol\n\nive heard young guy older woman is good: don nelson, dad, orion taraban, it makes sense with smv, we both have things to offer?\n\nbeing embarassing online isnt the goal, but im willing to right?

albeit parasocial, its 1 way, but if you do it too, we point to each other like visa said, and we can turn online relationships to offline, if we choose the same geographies\n\ngirls can choose another man.

okay..\n\njust because youre related doesnt mean youre close\n\njust like male friends friends, its just a girl friend\n\nwomen need men’s sword and shield (provide and protect)\n\nrelationship leverage / capital.

to build relationships at scale - david senra\n\nits ok to curate relationships but i need to double down on what remains AND find other s infinite players that energize\n\ndiversify / super invest in the best relationships.

thats the base of friendship is commonality no?\n\nfinding a mate is crucial for the species and since their is no neutral human, there are 2 genders who must resonate with their masculinity and feminity to create a 3rd note: children.

still get what you need and want, but have different relationships with different people and things, to get what you need and want..\n\nim excited to see the lifelong friendships, relationships, mentorships, menteeships, that come out of ns.

together we synergize for a particular gradient landscape\n\nwith my future girl, i wanna negotiate for novel sexual freedom and she can go and have a life if she finds a guy she emotionally resonates with\n\nwhat can i bring to to the relationship?

nah only watch with people i wanna be closer to.\n\nself, friends, girlfriend, sex, kids, more things to love outside the self\n\nif ig is an infidelity machine, then its also a "get a girlfriend" machine\n\nknowing how to love a woman is a great skill.

beautiful inside and out\n\nsuper build my self relationships and then relationships with people irl url.\n\nlet relationships slow cook\n\nFriendship is the meaning of life.\n\nrelationships should be opt in out\n\nbusiness partner and romantic partner\n\nlovelessness.

sexual marketplace value

women are mimietic in sesiring men

the game theory optimal way for good prisoners dilemma relationships is bid for long term, if they fuck with you, fuck them over / have boundaries, then try again for the long term, train them.

women usually have to have sex to then invest.\n\njust as its rare to find good guy friends, think the same for girl friends / girlfriends..\n\nI want to be around the people, as right now I view it as the most important resource, ever\n\nfinish one piece, thats my show with seb.

we will need 2-way internet more and more though\n\nwatch how girls talk about guys with other girls, thats a real feedback to know what they want\n\nin long relationships the small things add up becuase of value calculus overlapping differences\n\ngotta live on my own and women will be much more receptive.

this is a "on the horizon" thing\n\nwomen "long dating" romance book style, like how edward cant control himself around bella, is like the female equivalent of a harem of women that cant control themselves around the man, the setup works for them, and they just keep comin short term and shit, mind melting sex and all..

i want a gorgeous young wife who brings light and energy to my life, lots of great sex, a life of her own, we align on values, like the mind mapper app will show how much on paper we align on values.\n\n

can i bring myself to cut them?\n\ni want the people i follow to feel like a dream team of relationships\n\nthe more mentally aligned, the deeper you can go in your relationship\n\nfriends are mutual fans.

building leverage around what?\n\nin this modern atomized world, relationships, eternally important, need to be intentional, we cant count on passive relationships alone\n\nif there's jargon, I apologize, but I'm kinda writing half for myself, half to build relationships online, albeit parasocial and 1-sided\n\nwell relationships are a 2 way street, you can also better your life and we can stay in the same pack, or not..

oof\n\nrelationships should be opt in out\n\nwomen treat men like men treat jobs\n\nbusiness partner and romantic partner\n\nyou “purchase” relationships with virtue\n\nfriendships are like mutual subscriptions\n\nphysical and romantic attraction both matter\n\nare escorts short term wives and vice versa?\n\nwork on internet relationships: - relationships\n\ni dont want followers, i want peer relationships\n\npedastals prevent friendships.

be a good person, and meet who you fit best with\n\nmoney can def help more visible competence but its not a sufficient variable to help solve sexlessness\n\ngood relationships are where needs are met, and you dont need to get everything from the same person..\n\njust like its rare to find good male friends, same applies to girl friends, same applies to girlfriends\n\ni dont want to break their heart, and i dont want my heart broken either.

sounds so sociopathic omg

friends can setup dates thats so cool

so many single guys struggling, like me\n\nrelationships are built on bids for attention, and those bids met\n\nif a lot of divorces happen over money, then of course money is a great way to start a relationship, or atleast make it so that money isnt an issue to starting a relationship\n\nbusiness partner and romantic partner\n\nbuilding relationships at scale\n\nwhy am i doing this?

friends and girlfriendships are mutual fans.\n\nfinding a lover is also context dependent when it comes to attraction\n\nself, friends, girlfriend, sex, kids, more things to love outside the self\n\nthe sexual marketplace is the only competition that you cannot escape from.\n\nsuper build my self relationships and then relationships with people irl url.\n\nmen and women are meant to be together, we are one species, fit to each other\n\ni interacted a ton on X.

i mean

if a lot of divorces happen over money, then of course money is a great way to start a relationship, or atleast make it so that money isnt an issue to starting a relationship

talk about dating

business partner and romantic partner

write about dating

if you didnt like me then, then say no, unless i genuinely like them

friends can setup dates thats so cool

if you give girls weird feelings or NOT give them attractive feelings, they wont be with you...

making bids for friendship and love = relationships\n\nobviously its easy to click with people who are aligned, but you can also find commonalities among ANYONE you meet\n\nits ok to curate relationships but i need to double down on what remains AND find other s infinite players that energize\n\nsolve your sex problem with your understanding of sexual marketplace * diligent 8020 action: visible competence, confidence\n\na relationship built on mutual admiration and love.

how to meet the gems irl?\n\nmama relationship is problematic solve this with more cleaning\n\nalso money spent on infinite relationships is money well spent.\n\nfind people vertically befriend people who sees mini-them in me\n\nsexual goal: flirting with girlfriend and sex and cuddles and shit\n\nturn a friend into a lover, or find hot girls with good personality\n\npreselection in sexual marketplace is sorta like a ponzi scheme lol\n\nwill relationships that precede internet last post internet?

making bids for friendship and love = relationships\n\nif divorces are commonly due to lack of money, then a surplus of money is a great ENABLER of romantic relationships\n\ni noticed that in ns, most people spend time getting to know each other, then the building happens long term, theyre teaching each other shit\n\nwith my future girl, i wanna negotiate for novel sexual freedom and she can go and have a life if she finds a guy she emotionally resonates with\n\nsometimes the people who like you you dont want them to like you, and the people that YOU like dont like you.

punish them if they deserve, but keep trying for the good
