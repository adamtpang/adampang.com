how do you grandfather in urban design?

departments should collab and make typhoon proof.

so people can walk and bike in shade and rain\n\n

solar panel coverings/installations, directly connected to power grid.

opt in and out but kore expensive with social snd financial embeddedings\n\nhow do you retrofit unwalkable to walkable/bikeable.

do you have to reform the existing or start a new thing?\n\nmodern cities are bundled vectors that prove their values with relevant kpis.
