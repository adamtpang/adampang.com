why IG?

dont rush.

what then?

ok so what?

who are you?

so what does?

great framing.

induced demand?

S tier players.

do YOU like YOU?

what do i desire?

i do like status.

quantity quality.

i need to improve.

be authentic then?

to NOT be innocent?

chill the fuck out.

i am the prize too.

and what do you want?

i trust subconscious.

THEN find girls i like.

i feel like a kid: why?

advice cancels to zero.

do it badly on purpose.

or do i copy everything?

what do i saliently want?

maybe i just want novelty.

be an s tier person first.

do they give you bad vibes?

is it my desire or anothers?

maybe i do like fancy stuff.

i mean thats a legit reason.

what do you do with your life?

why is feelings non-masculine?

youll know

good general advice.

let them initiate initiation too.

who can i interview on each front?

then people like you will like you.

why do i care about being masculine?

just dont do what you dont want to do.

for guys, is your money a part of you?

what if being authentic is not enough?

damn im fucked lol

inner engineering.

rough and tumble play like rafe kelley.

outer engineering.\n\ntry to raise my smv.

why do i watch others to find what i think?

why cant i think for myself on these topics?

i and others can be so cruel, pretentious, etc.

so it makes sense why we dont like ourselves too.

become the man that saves the damsel in distress.

what if someone is better than you on all fronts?

if a frame is wrong, you must let it turn to water.

therapy, crossfit, jiu jitsu, soccer, rock climbing.

make you like you first
what dont i like about myself?

what does what i talk about say more about me than you?

i can leave Guam\n\nwhat do i do thats actually my own?

different doesnt mean good or bad it just means different.

not "things i tell myself" do what would make YOU like YOU.

insecurity, i want a girlfriend, but first I gotta like me.

im going extreme on trying social embodied meaning rituals.

maybe the fact that im asking the question is not masculine.

the woman that i want, i must earn, that is natural selection.

we are capable of great good and bad

did i want to be tainted?

i guess for tmi im only saying online what id say to a stranger?

etc\n\nlets be self aware, what are we too much of, too little of?

i notice that the axiomatic, base reasons sometimes dont excite me.

im lowkey more sensitive than my sisters, what am i supposed to do?

the question is "can material wealth outpace human growth?"

hold on.

wealth, fashion, fitness, calm mind\n\nbe an A player, only A players.

we act according to our nature\n\n

have i achieved what you are after?

is that just because im low status, and me saying that is a status move?

so im trying a bunch of different social sports, physical > digital games.

the on purpose part is crucial, you cant fail if youre failing on purpose.

make a great advice post, thats general and uncommon

how open should i be?

am i divergent because i just am or did i choose to, i wanted to be different?

im a dark horse per se thats growing everyday\n\nmen should level up, gain xp.

i deviate sometimes by nature, sometimes by choice

why are you listening to me?

women look for highest available xp men, and use that xp to invest in more life.

competition is for losers

being the best does indeed have rewards, but also drawbacks.

like how ill play badminton cause its a novel exercise, its social, and its good IG fuel.

being short is a positive constraint

can i even find guys i like / wanna be friends with?

sounds so sociopathic omg

solving lifees equations

you can have multiple motivations to do something.

do the things so that I like I

how to solve perfectionism: logotherapy franklâ€™s paradoxical intention.

scapple why am i doing xyz in life, and examine my life, be real about the reasons

i just keep asking why.

social validation

you can tell a lot about someone by their music
