maybe athon is right, its about memes and incentives..

these are like chaos and order\n\nmore razors and better showerheads?

its weird because at ns, its friends, but also business relattionships, so it gets tricky.

temu big carts only to reap the coupon shit the free games thats what theyre incentivizing for.

so dont do little orders do big orders like 10 50 100 things at a time, bulk orders mean i need to bulk get rid of stuff and sell\n\npeople will trade time for cash so they order temu slow but hella cheap\n\n
