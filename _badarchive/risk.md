look at worst downside best upside.

i define luck as "a positive outcome from the unknown"

how do you think about risk?

thats the risk spread in a way idk\n\ni love lyrics that say more than they say "i think im done nursing patients/patience" "where you can get what you want, but you can't get me"\n\n

here are the variables I think are at play:

knowns and unknowns

positive outcomes and negative outcomes (implies morality?)
