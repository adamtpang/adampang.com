onepace should crowdfund.

i have to figure this shit out.

i have a lot to learn and get better at.

micropayments with benefits like you get it early\n\nyou want inequality between past and future selves right?

in between stimulus and response is a gap, that is where growth occurs\n\ni feel thrown in the deep end of life.

super painful, confusing in the short term, but maybe best for the long term, forces me to grow up faster, figure things out, etc.

but i need and want to grow in life and gain self-mastery..\n\nhow to get better at anything, growth mindset and visa's do 100 things.

thats a GOOD kind of inequality, this means growth\n\nthe best defense against negative experiences with women is constant growth and success.

generate curate elevate, a creative way\n\n

finances, social, whatever\n\nevery time i catch myself doing something the same, try it a bit different.
