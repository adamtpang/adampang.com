we have to make trades here, the ideal president has not arrived, we cant get ben franklin in here rn lol he dead\n\ni would vote for trump because hes the lesser of 2 evils.

heres why: trump's economic policies are better -> more material prosperity, i dont care so much about his brash personality or scandalous past, i care more about the gov policies.

we cant choose who our family is, where were born, we play with the cards we have, we make new cards\n\nwere there previous political candidates with the kind of fan base like trump supporters?

because how are you supposed to make decade long positive plans without decades of operative power?\n\nin politics people talk past each other: some focus on economic policies some on personality/gayrights etc.

or is it because of tribal politicization and the digital age where an outcome like this emerges?\n\nwow lky said democracy does not change gov without viiolence, but in terms of effeciency it clearly lacks.
