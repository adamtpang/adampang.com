stoic locus of control\n\n

quality over the internet..

list -> 8020 -> caldump -> cal\n\nlong term tech strat.

have a plan AND experiment, espeically with gatekeepers.

clear goals immediate feedback challenge skills balance.

you can come out of nowhere unto the radar of competence.

you can come out of nowhere unto the radar of competence.

"good" - jocko willink, use the problem to your advantage.

do once, have extended functionality\n\nsort by fun level.

1 minute -> 10 minute.\n\nremember covid when you stayed in the same place for months?

shouldnt we buy from china, but build what we cant buy?\n\nive learned to read the game.

dont die + compound + asymmetric upside\n\nsystems and process toward a goal based on values?

its the orchestration\n\ngo to the schelling point where top people are solving your top problem.

if code ai is getting better, use it.\n\nhave a plan AND experiment, espeically with gatekeepers.

specific rare low supply high demand knowledge and positioning of resources\n\nyeah i can just look.

Become Indispensable to the World Singapore made itself a port, financial hub, and refueling station.

be defensive and offensive\n\nyou can lower standards in the micro but retain standards for the macro.

minimum effective solution\n\nmaybe my next obsession i already have on my radar but its not relevant YET.

the setup, the leverage, then the final output will be easy, itll be the press of a button, build leverage.

permissionless leverage, experiments with problem solving, building leverage, central hub of personal site.

like agario, grow so you can consume the thing.\n\ni love love how noah kagan doesnt take himself so seriously.

up and up the throughline and logos, this is the infinite game\n\nthere are zeroth game moves: free speech, etc.

its the right time to engage with it for my goals values and strategies\n\nstudy the playbook, create the playbook, play it.

make principled strategic moved\n\ni can also pagerank off of wealthy and famous people, and just partner and interface with them.

cause its infinite leverage, so judgement..\n\nsalient goals, delete, values/direction, strat * time = meaning and you get your goals.

you need both product value and distribution channel for value-capture\n\ndont be a masochist but yeah be strong be fast be dextrous etc.

find things that are cheap for, expensive for others, that guarantees youre low supply on that vector\n\nwork backward from the goal state.

its not a mutual exclusive thing\n\nthe best strategy is the sustainable one\n\ndont get trapped in local minima, its the meta game that really matters.

the first rules we need to establish before even playing the infinite game infinite through time and space\n\nwith quality you can shoot to the top easily.

Talent factory?"\n\nmake 1 minute videos until i get people watching, then 2 minute, then 4 minutes then 8, increasing length when theres more people watching.

up and up the throughline and logos, this is the infinite game\n\nby reshoring usa manufacturing, are we competing, and therefore through thiel's lens, be losers?

punish them if they deserve, but keep trying for the good\n\nor have a twtitter account for shitposting* and experimentation, then 1 account for the timeless stuff that works.

2 independent things\n\nwhen both are polished, post 8020 and caldump on X and IG, where ive already built trust, and also point to where you can find my new upcoming projects.

after i can read the game well to get what i want, i focus on the 1-2 things that REALLY fuckin matter, FOR ME\n\ni dont want to work hard, i want to work diligently and intelligently and wisely.

like dont compete with china on manufacturing\n\nfor every ns and vector, detail short term medium term long term plans (each a different mag, like 1-3 is short term, 4-6 is medium, 7-9 is long term.

in soccer, in finances (cutting), in government spending\n\nvalues are what you want, strategy is procedure, goal states are specific desires\n\nshort form content should point to your longer term content.

identify what market it is, then be a buyer or seller depending.\n\nbetter to polarize early and know who the infinite game players are vs the leech finite game players\n\nwith every problem, take the biggest ones and tackle em.

self, males, females, girlfriends.\n\nthe game theory optimal way for good prisoners dilemma relationships is bid for long term, if they fuck with you, fuck them over / have boundaries, then try again for the long term, train them.

in soccer, in finances (cutting), in government spending\n\nvalues are what you want, strategy is procedure, goal states are specific desires\n\nsalient goals, delete, values/direction, strat * time = meaning and you get your goals.

eat the space, just like in soccer.\n\ncreate 100, curate 80, elevate 20.\n\npermissionless vs permissioned strategies in life\n\nfind a working strategy that doesnt scale, then scale that\n\nlook at the principles of the long game too.

naivety CAN be good.\n\nif you have not felt the pain of bad vectors: values strategy goals, you wont REALLY focus on fixing em and getting solutions and better explanations strategies and better results\n\nthiel-competiveness is like not competing directly, but competing in results.

make principled strategic moved\n\nif you have not felt the pain of bad vectors: values strategy goals, you wont REALLY focus on fixing em and getting solutions and better explanations strategies and better results\n\nthiel-competiveness is like not competing directly, but competing in results.

like a breadth account and a depth account, or ill go into more depth the more people engage with a thought or meme, its a curated account\n\nfast and steady wins the race: exploring exploiting optimally\n\ni love freedom clarity of plan, good values, good strategy, to good goals\n\ndefense then offense.

values are the most mysterious part of the trifecta for me: of values strat and goal states\n\ni want to talk more about antirational memes, that disable thought, and the importance of detecting and removing them, from minds and cultures.\n\njust promote to the internal ns discord to start, then can do x warpcast etc.
