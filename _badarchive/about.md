My name is Adam Tomas Guzman Pangelinan, I was born on Guam, 2002 at Sagua Managu.

My Father’s name is Karl Anthony Pangelinan, my mother’s name is Shana Dolores Guzman.

My older sister is Isabella Matea pangelinan, and my younger sister is kamia lynn pangelinan.

I had a good childhood.

3
I went to Mercy heights daycare


5
I went to saint anthony catholic school

6
I played rock band a lot with my father and sister, and this was a very formative video game that i played that.


13
I had an existential crisis at 13-14. I dont know exactly why but i started to question everything in a descartes fashion (ugh). I couldnt bring myself to do any homework, i racked up 25+ missing assignments (common pattern in my life) because nothing mattered to me more than figuring out the truth of it all idk. But this pattern will turn out to cause self-directed grief in his life…


finds philosophy

14
I started highschool at father duenas memorial school, and was in the class band for songfest, a yearly competition between each class. I wrote the song freshman year

18 (2020)
Upon graduation, i spent 3 months writing and producing music. Covid had started and my sisters and i were really into kpop. My sister bella got into blackpink, and it just took over the house.

I started working for my family business because my mom was saying that i had to start contributing to the household since i was an adult and living there.

I worked in the sales department at international distributors, my family business started by my grandfather frank guzman, hes a hero of mine. I seem to try to live up to him in some ways, and try to live down the sins of my father. I want to be a good father, but first i gotta be a good 22 year old haha. I was kinda miserable doing sales, so i plotted an escape. The good thing was that PUA from covid and my 6 months of working, and with some investing on robinhood s&p500 and some crypto investments on paypal and coinbase got me to 10k in savings! yay

19
Then i tried real estate, and passed my exam. But the firm ended up being a scam so i left after three months of that in the summer

Then i did a summer trip with my nana on my dads side to washington and texas, where i spent time with my auntie creed and auntie ange, they were on 2 opposite sides of the political spectrum. I had already started trying a semester of school. But it was zoom school, and sucked. Keep in mind ive never had a girlfriend at this point. I was friends with girls in middle school, but here are the reasons i can think of why not: i had an existential crisis at 13-14, i didnt get my drivers license till 17, covid hit at 18, i didnt go to college, and the one semester that i did try was zoom school, so only 1 class on campus, and im also mentally different from the people on guam.

20 (2022)
So toward the end of the semester at UOG (university of guam), i found out about coding. So i was self-teaching myself with “100 days of code udemy course”, then after months of that, and coding my productivity desktop tool “comparrow” my mom suggested i needed more structure, so i started looking into coding bootcamps, and started prepping and applying to “app academy” in sf. I prepped, got in, and was on my way to sf for 4 months at the end of 2022.

21 (2023)
sf bootcamp. So i was at sf, my dad dropped me off, and i was living in a coliving house called “908” for 4 months, and app academy was a 20 minute walk down to union square in SF. right when we arrived though in september of 2022, chatgpt came out, covid was hitting hard, and the tech markets fell like a rock. We still finished it, but only the people that were in the bay area really got jobs. Sad face.. So the rest of us spent up to a year trying to find tech employment. I remember living with my dad through this idk why, i think i got kicked out of the house or something. Nothing was really working, on-island applications, online applications. I remember family came to visit too.


22 (2024)
I did a GPA energy internship summer of 2024, i needed the cash for sure, i was in debt. I worked here for 3 months. I was trying my hand at a lot of hardware things, i was into it at the time. I wanted to learn about energy because i knew it was super important for technology, a career space i was interested in. it was a dead end job but im grateful that my auntie pulled some strings for me, not that i was any less competent than the other young interns, i actually helped by writing scripts that helped get the excel processes from 2 hours to 2 minutes. (useful!)

I also started my own company anchormarianas.com! Its half an app studio for indiehacking, was learning about this at the time and coding up my own apps, and also for freelancing, i did a gig for local hilton and got 250 dollars ;) its embarrassing now that im at ns and people are way more successful there than that, but i got 13 dollars in indiehacking cash, and 250 dollars from freelancing.

So my dad was in a really rough place, in april, i was living with him for 3-4 months and he revealed to all his kids about his financial and drug problems. Then i left his house.

Right after, i spend 2k and 1 week or so going to singapore for the dont die summit and the network state conference, from following people on X and following the people with good ideas. It was a life changing experience. I also made some friends and decided to sneak into balaji’s network school because we were both leaving in a couple days and we wanted to see what it was about. Now im an actual student”” there but youll hear more about that soon. We had 3 days left before we had to leave singapore, i was staying at a capsule hotel in chinatown, and we had lunch that day, then left. Maybe were insane and folly, idk. We had to figure out how to cross the border, be internet-detectives to figure out where it was. It was good because we came on the first day, so we could just act like students. We sat across pieter levels in the lobby. I did a burn class with talmage johnson. We stayed at the nearby golf hotel for 2 days and commuted back and forth and made friends.

My dad started a container farm business, verticalguam.com, its still working out its last legal doc for funding before i can be employee #1 (i dont like working with him but i need the cash). Im the only one in my immediate family that is still in contact with him, i believe in redemption i guess, for myself too. But idk if im in bad company just because i need money. Idk how to reconcile this yet.)

I kept going to coffee shops like infusion and slowalk to work during these times.

When i got back home i was living with my mom, but then i got kicked out i forgot why on new years. So i started living with my nana for 2 months. It was nice to help her. My auntie sid got mad at me for being trump-tolerant, then apologized later. That was confusing.

Then i applied and got into balaji’s network school, the same secret forest city malaysia school that i snuck into before: ns.com. It was a crazy morning when i received that acceptance. It was the first thing in the tech world that accepted me. So im treating it like school, i didnt really go to college so im cashing that in now and im really grateful my mom is helping me financially.

So i did 3 months at ns, it was really fun in the beginning and I was going kinda crazy at ns toward the end. so i last-minute decided to come back home for a summer break, to reset and gain clarity, then ill try and stay out there for 5 months, but im not sure how, till winter break..

Now im back at ns, gonna turn 23 soon, feelin bad lately. No super promising income options, i mean there are but im not THAT interested in them. I dont want to force myself to do anything i dont want to, but that doesnt change the fact that i still have problems: ns survival / mental health / life clarity, moneymaking, and finding love. I know that i can in principle solve all my problems, i just need to figure out how. I need to learn working theories, and test them, and upgrade them, etc.. i know i can do it. But what do i do today? Keep learning? Experiment? I want the pain in my shoulders and back to go away, idk why im so stressed. I mean i have guesses. I miss home in a way, but home wasnt perfect either, so i need to figure life out here too. I need to be willing to be wrong, experiment in good faith, learn and be curious. Solve my problems, forgive myself..
