wow.

poles.

polarity.

what else?

i know quantum is more.

maybe our understanding of it?

maybe our understanding of it?

magnets both repel and attract.

every piece of matter affects every others gravitational field.

cut first before adding.\n\nthe physics wont change in 100 years.

social engineering physics/principles\n\nthe physics wont change in 100 years.

right and there is no gravitational field or whatever but its a shallow analogy.\n\n

maybe well have the physics grand unifying theory\n\neverything affects everything relativity and all.

maybe well have the physics grand unifying theory\n\nnever forget deutschian lens: all is possible if permissible by physics\n\ndoes time move at this speed because of relativity and gravity ajd speed?\n\nmagnets are vector axis too.

physical?\n\nif it does not break the laws of physics, it is possible\n\nlaws of physics and people\n\ncourage explores physics\n\ncourage explores physics\n\ngenerate gravity through mass.\n\npost about learning about the everett\n\nif it does not break physics, its possible?\n\nif it does not break physics it is possible.\n\nif it does not break physics, it is possible\n\nif it does not break physics, it is possible.\n\nnever forget deutschian lens: all is possible if permissible by physics\n\nevery value vector is a mini-religion.
