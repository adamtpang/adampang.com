AP means advanced placement.

diligence.\n\n

what do i want?

the truth will set us all free.

if it makes sense then follow it.

IM FUCKING SEXUAL AND THATS OKAY.

i like girls omg, and thats okay.

trying tons of new physical games.

less impatience, more presentness?

better quality from more quantity.

is christianity the final religion?

its a challenge

why am i doing this?

its fucking pathetic, and sad yeah...

can i learn from a college educated person.

makes me feel horrible letting people down.

its funny how magnets both attract and repel.

idk what im talking about when it comes to AI.

like agario, grow so you can consume the thing.

if i dont feel like im saying what i wanna say.

will i still punish myself for that in 30 years?

talk about missed commitments, do the meta thing.

not all smiles\n\nsuccess is "self actualization?

i wasnt adam yet, my identity was on top of being.

i want to be seen as someone who follows through???

stop reading me, what are you doing with your life?

ATP / adenosine triphosphate, the energy of the cell.

i can make beautiful decisions, courageous decisions.

import the notes i took that day in notebook, in keep.

i wanna live a full life

filter out for the new names.

polarization is the opposite of the lukewarm, be bolder.

talk about recent news with me like incorporating .townhall.

talk about being off socials whole life then now on socials.

maybe its just an innate social interest

naval said it best.

but i know i am and i still am willing to be for what i want?

i started forgetting memories at 17, maybe i filled up my brain.

dont say what i wont do

the question is where do we go from here?

then learn from THEM

i gotta stop saying yes to things i cant keep.

whenever i drop a commitment, i feel like telling everyone who knew.

youre never late, maybe for a local minima, but never for the global.

i dont like that feeling of being in a permissioned kissass position.

i like how the human mind autoforgets, its like LIFO, use it or lose it.

but if im stagnating, i feel like shit and the bullshit hurts way way more.

talk about my life and why i made certain decisions

often i forget insights.

im a fucking human, i went to a prostitute, i wanted to have sex really badly.

now im learning and am becoming more independent so thats good\n\ndo 100 thing.

lets learn and do

i love being honest, but i wont share secrets unless i forget.

i go to therapy, i gotta talk about this, i gotta work on permissionless leverage.

ive been taking care of sleep diet exercise, hanging out, building a social circle.

how does thinking about these concepts and histories change the way that i live life?

im so sorry for those people i asked in neediness, like kasra, bruno, judah hyperdata.

get the fundamentals right


talk about important topics even if its embarassing or scary to.

pain is plasticity, going deeper into the training of the neural net, backprop, forward prop.

like sia idk\n\nput a pic of me on personal site\n\ninner scorecards OP\n\ninner engineering.

the ever expanding puzzle of life

this is my fate, i love it


these great thinkers are people too.

this is not relevant

i hired a prostitute just like in the sopranos

my full name is adam tomas pangelinan.

i fell into temptation like watching porn, i havent watched in like 3 years or something and im fucking proud of that.

make sure to not destroy the means of error correction: experiments, dialogue, first principles, emotional disaster prep.

when emotions run high, and blood boils, morals can be thrown out easily

i used to be so desperate for a job asking people.

outer engineering.\n\nfollow din khavisov?\n\ncursor needs console / terminal context.\n\nshow some hard sides of myself on X and IG.

playing yourself out fully, all the way to the end." also self and relational..\n\nbefore you could smell the nediness from me a mile away.

i dont need to overcorrect for dad, i used to think being sexual was a sin or something, that rings true and makes sense on why i am how i am.

lol

feedback / truth is a gift

it is through the testing that you will find your own unique path

learn from people you hate / biased against.

but to say that im not supposed to be sexual, thats fucked up, were fucking human, and the only reason were here talking is because our parents were sexual.

i like my abbreviations

put a pic of me on personal site

fullstack human

put a pic of me on personal site

you can have your face online, just dont push it.

i didnt want to get famous, i didnt identify like that, like a popular jock person, i was more smart artsy, but now im more into extroverted athletic stuff too.

but right now ill go for speed and volume

theres so much OFFLINE
imagine the new people that are coming online, new people being born, more life, more prosperity and meaning.

im just gonna write what i want, ill make it for me like rick rubin said, and also thats how ill be a magnet for people like me, and vice versa, i gravitate to people i admire.

glad i documented

cant doxx me if i doxx myself lol, the 8mile defense is voluntary vulnerability

to a sensitive person, theres so much thats fuckin salient, for better or worse.

but i fucking ask girls for their number (4 times), i got rejected 4 times, i work on myself, my health, my tech career, im not asking for pity, im just saying 100% ive been trying.

list what ive learned from each exemplar, some are so embedded

when the student is ready, the master appears

talk about avoiding things that i should do vs my whole self is aligned with it.

like blackbeard, double power, double pain

in blog: i just wanna share stuff with people, and if i dont have people that wanna hear what i wanna say, i feel ignored

what im afraid to write about?

internship ending and singapore plans

partial truthsll get ya, and lead you down incomplete roads

i learned what to be public about and what to be private about

i stopped 3x speed and skipping songs.

better to know truth always, even if it costs you, because its an ROI in long term truth

when you learn, your vocab and axiomatic frameworks change


have a plan AND experiment, espeically with gatekeepers.

if you talk to enough people, read enough books, do mushrooms, meditate enough, you realize its all connected, dont box yourself in, be a natural philosopher

i can be super needy cringe awkward embarrising.

motivationally, if i dont agree with doing something, i just find it super hard to do, but if my whole self can agree and align with a certain task, im all for it, the chakras align lol and i go into avatar state.

the unexamined life is not worth living

as long as you disagree with parts of your heroes, you know youre safe from mimetic downsides

as long as i progress on the important life dimensions i prioritize, i can take a lot more bullshit life throws me.

i like when i get super into something, life breaks my frame, then i see it was foolish or thats not where i should focus/allocate attention

talk about projects i wanna do and why

my psychadelic experience was like the frames were dissolved from the ground up and i had to learn how to be again.

truth can be ugly

talk about what id identify with: music philosophy writing technology (software hardware bioware)

this blog is just public notes, sometimes curated

talk about fun facts or quirks, like every time i do something im proud of i pat myself twice


YOOOOOO im gonna see balaji, bryan johnson, and HUBERMAN!!!, and vitalik too love you bby lol

randome musings

i hired a prostitute because i was so tired being a virgin, it was like guma' uritao, i wanted to know what it was like.
