cheap?

the wild makes you antifragile.

MLS?\n\n"dont do anything that someone else can do" the principle of additionality.

get vinyls and xbox from sebs first\n\n

how do you know who owns each plot of land?

optimize for game time..\n\nwith any creation like code or media, make it super easy to do, for yourself.

simplify\n\nive failed so much, been rejected so much, looked down on so much, but fuck that im going to rise and grow\n\nhelp the ns core team find the righ land given their criteria: shoreline?

skillstacking makes you one of a kind by combinatorics.\n\nfor career resilience, have multiple skills, so if you get fired from one, fear set, premeditatio malorum for worst case and make sure you can easily go to a backup\n\nsell vinyls, golf clubs clothes etc.
