i guess those are the bounties.

build or fund it, or culture it.

knows when you need to do which.

like the tower of babel, you go up and up and up, and when you inevtiably face an unknown, an error, a wrong judgement, the internal wiring topples down to the point where it BECAME wrong.

Xray.social - Analytics + Actions for X and IG: This project addresses the issue of flat metrics in social media, providing a deeper analysis of quality over quantity, which is innovative.

Engagement Boost: Such a feature could increase user engagement as people explore new connections and content.\n\nEcho Chamber Effect: If the algorithm only surfaces accounts similar to those already followed, it might reinforce existing views or interests, limiting exposure to diverse perspectives.

Ethical Considerations: Ensuring this tool promotes healthy discourse and does not exacerbate social divides would be crucial.\n\nNetwork Discovery: Users could discover new, high-quality accounts or "gems" that align with their interests but are not yet in their network, enhancing their X experience.
