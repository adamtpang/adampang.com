![Cover Image](/public/images/preview.png)

This post has an image at the top, which should automatically become the cover image on the blog listing page.

Here's some content with a link: https://github.com/adamtpang

And here's a proper markdown link: [My GitHub](https://github.com/adamtpang)

Links should be automatically formatted and clickable!
