title: "Welcome to My Blog"
---

This is my first blog post. I wanted to create a simple, clean space to share thoughts and ideas - inspired by blogs like [nav.al](https://nav.al) and [sive.rs](https://sive.rs).

## Why Blog?

Writing helps clarify thinking. By putting ideas into words, we're forced to examine them more closely.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- Technology and programming
- Ideas and observations
- Books and learning
- Whatever seems worth sharing

## Simple is Better

This blog is intentionally minimal. No comments, no social media buttons, no analytics tracking. Just words and ideas.

Thanks for reading.
