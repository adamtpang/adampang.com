# Life Advice: Compressed Truths for Better Living

*A collection of hard-won wisdom distilled into actionable principles*

Life is fundamentally about problem-solving and decision-making. After years of mistakes, experiments, and learning from mentors, I've compiled these compressed truths‚Äîthe advice I wish I'd had earlier, organized for quick reference during life's challenging moments.

## On Self-Improvement

**Live so you like you.** This is the foundation. Before seeking approval from others, build a relationship with yourself that you can be proud of. You're the only one who knows the full story of your efforts and intentions.

**Problems are solvable.** Every challenge you face has been solved by someone, somewhere. The question isn't whether it's possible‚Äîit's whether you're willing to learn and act on the solution.

**Be wrong on purpose.** Seek out your mistakes early when they're cheap to fix. Being wrong quickly is better than being right slowly. Test your assumptions before they become expensive failures.

**Do 100 things.** Want to get good at something? Do it 100 times. Volume plus feedback creates competence faster than perfectionism creates paralysis.

## On Relationships

**Simply be her best option.** In dating, don't chase‚Äîattract. Work on becoming someone worth choosing rather than convincing someone to choose you.

**Win and help win.** The best relationships are positive-sum. Success isn't about beating others; it's about elevating everyone in your circle.

**Ignore so much that only good remains.** Curation is everything. The people you spend time with, the content you consume, the problems you focus on‚Äîchoose deliberately.

**Never pedastalize people.** Heroes are just people further along the path. Admire their work, not their person. This keeps you humble and them human.

## On Work and Wealth

**Be so good they can't ignore you.** Competence opens doors that networking can't. Focus on building skills that create undeniable value.

**Productize yourself.** Find the intersection of what you're good at, what you enjoy, and what people will pay for. Then systematize it.

**Never trade time for money long-term.** Build leverage through code, media, capital, or people. Your goal is to disconnect input from output.

**Solve problems, don't compete.** Competition is for losers. Find problems only you can solve in ways only you can solve them.

## On Decision-Making

**Hell yeah or no.** If you're not excited about an opportunity, it's probably not worth your time. Mediocre yeses kill great possibilities.

**Choose long-term over short-term.** Most regrets come from optimizing for immediate gratification at the expense of future wellbeing.

**Stress is untaken action.** When anxiety builds, it's usually because you know what needs to be done but aren't doing it. Act, and stress dissolves.

**The greatest power is walking away.** Options create freedom. Always maintain the ability to say no to anything or anyone.

## On Learning

**Understanding precedes action.** Don't just copy tactics‚Äîunderstand principles. This lets you adapt when circumstances change.

**Learn from people you hate.** They often reveal your blind spots better than friends who agree with you.

**All advice cancels to zero.** Take wisdom from many sources, but think for yourself. What works for others might not work for you.

**If it repeats, systematize it.** When the same problem keeps appearing, create a system to handle it automatically.

## On Health and Happiness

**A calm mind, a fit body, a house full of love.** These three pillars support everything else. They can't be bought‚Äîonly earned through consistent practice.

**Sleep is non-negotiable.** Poor sleep destroys decision-making, creativity, and relationships. Prioritize it like your life depends on it‚Äîbecause it does.

**Energy management beats time management.** Work with your natural rhythms. Do your most important work when you're strongest.

**Presence is a gift.** The person who shows up fully‚Äîin conversation, in work, in relationships‚Äîbecomes magnetic.

## On Courage

**Do what scares you (if it won't kill you).** Growth lives on the other side of fear. The things you're avoiding often hold your biggest breakthroughs.

**Never let cowardice be a bottleneck.** Skills can be learned, resources can be found, but courage must come from within.

**Failure is irrelevant unless catastrophic.** Most failures are feedback in disguise. The only real failure is not learning from the attempt.

## Daily Reminders

- **Problems are opportunities for virtue**
- **The bad is next to the good**
- **Focus on what you want to see more of**
- **Every no gets you closer to a yes**
- **You can figure it out**
- **Just solve problems**

## The Meta-Principle

Behind all advice lies one truth: you must take responsibility for your own life. No guru, system, or philosophy can substitute for your own judgment and action. Use these principles as tools, not rules. Adapt them to your unique situation and discard what doesn't serve you.

Life is the best game you'll ever play. Play it well.
