re: kanye.

unwanted attention?

how much "SHOULD" i share?

its basically like speaking at a podium in an ancient tribe.

but what weird person would read all this random shit just cause?

i will oscillate.fun facts

this is the analogy im thinking of

...

youd be here reading this blog because you were genuinely curious

...

like dave chappel said: not a crazy thing to think, but a crazy thing to say outloud.

what are the pros and cons of sharing things, especially things that make you vulnerable?

there are so many embarassing things i could write about
vulnerability breeds trust
vice-signalling > virtue signalling

how much should you share online?

i was super skeptical and scared of putting myself online, but after lots of deliberation im making the conscious choice too, the inaction cost is too great

what is the worst case?

i want to be relevant, honest, useful

basically the overton window and scapegoat risk, being internet stoned to death idk

i will be now strategic and err on the side of NOT sharing.
