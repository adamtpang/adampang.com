i like when i get super into something, life breaks my frame, then i see it was foolish or thats not where i should focus/allocate attention

attraction: combinatoric skills knowledge connections location

someones music, the books they read, the people they follow on X, what they watch on youtube, says a lot, their favorite movies

solving lifees equations

i want to earn just enough that its higher than my burn (+800$), but i really want time for code and media

do a run down about

maybe as you get older, and see yourself in older people, they become more seen to yourself as malleable, like "why dont you do this?"
