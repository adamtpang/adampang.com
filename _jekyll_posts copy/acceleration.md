thats what were working on, the WHAT.

only ask for money when accelerating.

that is honestly a bottleneck i feel.

+ point code and media to each other.

each community is a mosaic of values.

startung with one mag, then 2 then 3.

fixed and percentage growth or costs.

we need explanations too yadda yadda.

- accountability is skin in the game.

code and media pointed at each other.

if there is doubt, there is no doubt.

dm me\n\nleverage is like an exoskeleton.

just need 1-2 examples along each vector.

and actually execution is more important.

10 minute slices using veed or descript..

immense reward comes after the sacrifice.

- the first apple sale was made barefoot.

life compilor\n\nbe ahead, sell solution.

the presales have a ladder of commitment.

and actually execution is more important.

"at what cost?" how do you need to change?

you can garden 0 to 100 seeds if you need.

i can be a smart rust contract or something..

elon is michael jordan basically, he's messi.

ill talk with ben about threadmaking i think.

so i can combine things like philosophy tech.

you cannot separate the trial from the error.

bettering my understanding of software ideas.

bettering my understanding of software ideas.

the implications for fast and iteratable laws.

i gotta code though too for the network state.

but maybe have a life with one great girl idk.

It compounds over time​\n\nexplore experiment.

code equity media capital labor relationships.

this is what i gotta figure out post singapore.

make it a nobrainer for why its a good project.

i have a lot i think i could teach to you guys.

we need more vectorized group chats and podcasts.

(power law)\n\nwhere are you directing your force?

use natural ways to better yourself and tech ways.

only dial up dial down?\n\nwhat is my talent stack?

stability and dynamism by themselves arent virtues.

code and media solve problems and make shit happen.

also rate by timeless vs temporary and polish each.

i only got serious online maybe the last 1-2 years.

i just needa pay my bills rn so tryna build wealth.

just gotta be sustainable profit and expenses wise.

my big 5: philosophy startups, soccer health music.

the 1st is radically better than the 3rd best choice.

working on permissionless code equity media leverage.

do 1 then 2 then 4 then 8 then 16 then 32, up and up.

also you can set up recovery exercise accountability.

Winning defined as achieving what you sent out to do.

ugh ** also sales depends on whose doing the chasing..

and word of mouth elevates.\n\nso what am i going for?

different projects take different scopes of resources.

i LOVE vector math analogies, also vector sum is good.

more important than “hard work” and “hours clocked in”?

add friction to the bad, subtract friction to the good.

+ the ingredients of the modern world were always here.

product * sales.\n\nit goes back to unlearning money...

see all platforms and postbridge and reelfarm and shit.

propositional, procedural, perspectival, participatory.

like with technology — you get better, faster, cheaper.

i can also note the time between each repo, self study.

i can also note the time between each repo, self study.

100 posts/stories and 100 dms.\n\ncreate curate elevate.

generate a set, sort set, double down on the 1-2 things.

dont go to zero, create systems, keep correcting errors.

learn, then post to IG and X to show visible competence.

sure keep it seperate...\n\none more clip or more today.

say AM site stealh mode big project, and "helps X do Y".

code leverage and media leverage pointing to each other.

better faster cheaper, this serves you and your society.

socially, physically, financially, life experience wise.

make my best guesses and update model after reflection..

what if i turn each post with pics into a video with ai.

better faster cheaper, this serves you and your society.

accuracy and acceleration\n\ni like making websites fast.

you cant change the shape, but you can move up the shape.

build in public, learn in public\n\nwith infinite leverage.

follow that doubt, revert till you find solid ground again.

the smallest things can topple the biggest things like btc.

humans have a competitive and violent side to em deep down?

then people can help fund and accelerate a certain project.

the goal is to succeed, not to make your map more accurate.

errors lead to plasticity, which with grit lead to success.

2 independent things\n\nwhat am i afraid of that i must do?

then people can help fund and accelerate a certain project.

i need to execute more.\n\nif its hard along a great vector.

so results proof and credibility association from my heroes.

but every choice online is how you accelerate what you want.

althea talked about the founders are good at being decisive.

check maslows i guess, tweak internet presence, make amends?

check maslows i guess, tweak internet presence, make amends?

the desire the meaning the relevance is all along that path.

speed and endurance in input, quantity and quality in output.

but dont overburst growth if it jeapordizes Long term growth.

like what would you do if you had 10k 100k up the magnitudes.

you can act as fast as you want.\n\ni see a path to infinity.

idk just use the logofast one for now, but SOMETHING special?

but dont overburst growth if it jeapordizes Long term growth.

like what would you do if you had 10k 100k up the magnitudes.

i can do code and media and sales for permissionless leverage.

resequence this and post and replace infinite with the symbol.

sounds kinda degrowthy but i do not mean that let me be clear.

internet leverage baby!\n\nthere are actually few quality songs.

i think it could be value, try to sell it to people and help em.

ask family and friends too to help if they want a certain thing.

maybe this has to do with the calculus of orchestration of life.

put your mind online but only the timeless and public-compliant.

conversation was original, reading was a newer psychotechnology.

ask family and friends too to help if they want a certain thing.

around a mission purpose, like mars party\n\ni can increase sleep.

work on nailing the experience with the 10 people, the 100 people.

models for all zero to one projects, scaling, end to end business.

imagine if the steves were too stubborn on making blue boxes work.

where is the most free dynamic, technooptimist place in the world?

yeah using ai + creative coding + visuals audio, this is stacking.

well ideas are important but useless if nothing is done with them.

i'm becoming more convinced of this "do 100 thing" practice ethos.

life is orchestration.\n\n- ideally, you earn with just your mind.

models for all zero to one projects, scaling, end to end business.

and after anchorm site is done, email lemonsqueezy to get it done.

well ideas are important but useless if nothing is done with them.

hes an online teacher, an effectiveness guru\n\nremove bottlenecks.
