so they know..

who am i kidding..

stoic locus of control.

so prioritize and execute..

ive only been there 3 months.

guam should learn independence.

ive heard of people planning them.

try in practice, not just in theory.

agent arena relationship, sense of self.

and ill repost from my experimental account.

to see things first hand, itll hit different.

how do i improve myself though, and improve it.

i wasnt adam yet, my identity was on top of being.

i wasnt adam yet, my identity was on top of being.

noone ever said im so sad i became too independent.

import the notes i took that day in notebook, in keep.

if the principles say its not possible, then trust that.

dont work with people you cant be friends with* generally.

dont work with people you cant be friends with* generally.

oscillate the process, and be mindful about what mode im in.

life is too short for that\n\n

guam should learn independence.

maybe vr fieldtrips / immersion / actual field trips will help.

words dont do it justice gigi ns diary 0\n\nshared experiences.

follow physics, follow God, dont look around to others too much.

and of course partner with people we cant go long without friends.

and of course partner with people we cant go long without friends.

you cant control others, and you can control certain parts of the arena.

but its gotta click for you IN PRINCIPLE, not just because people say so.

of course learn from the masters and follow your taste, but follow\n\ngrow up!

most of all in my life I should learn independence, financially, productively.

experiment mode, then edit mode.\n\nwe should go to singapore and see an orchestra?

natural emergent properties of those who are engaged free etc\n\ntrust the principles.

emergence is a fascinating topic\n\neverything i notice myself doing, try the opposite.

some people that only know what its like because theyre living the similar experience you are.

first tweets, now apps, maybe pods too.\n\ngenuine interest cannot be taught, it naturally emerges.

reversible decisions\n\ndo 100 of something, and once i reach that, THEN im allowed to be a perfectionist.

glad i documented

my psychadelic experience was like the frames were dissolved from the ground up and i had to learn how to be again.

etc write about that experience\n\nor have a twtitter account for shitposting* and experimentation, then 1 account for the timeless stuff that works.

positive emergent properties appear\n\nim fascinated by emergence, and things we dont quite understand yet\n\nmake the do 100 thing experiment thread.

like a breadth account and a depth account, or ill go into more depth the more people engage with a thought or meme, its a curated account\n\ngrow up!

glad i documented\n\ninterplay of bottom up emergence and top down design\n\ninterplay of bottom up emergence and top down design\n\nwith great fundamentals.

life is too short for that\n\ntalk about if you havent lived inflation, or ran into trouble with fda, or havent felt the decline of usa, or felt the rise of internet and china, you only know it in your head, but you dont know it in the sense of “you feel it in your bones”.

"were going to science the shit out of this"\n\nsometimes you gotta try a past experiment because other variables are diff now vs then\n\nwrite about the smile crying i yearn for the type i experienced at that 908 dinner where i cried from laughing at a song with oriol clem.

or just vr and really good as headphones or speakers, and have an immersive experience at an ns room, like sensory deprivation with epsom salt whatever, minimal caffeine\n\nim very interested in parasitic memes and how to exercise them from you, also super interested in emergent properties, things you cant force, that emerge, its a more of unblocking it..

talk about unique things that ive done
building a bamboo ladder, my uncle said i couldnt
philosophy club
using stripe atlas for personal company LLC
overwhelm
dont die and network state conference

i need stuff to point people to that will outlast my singapore trip:
personal site
blog
remove podcast for now
projects i made: townhall with eth escrow
remove some links
