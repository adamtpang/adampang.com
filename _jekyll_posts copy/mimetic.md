people copy other people, if noone critically thinks, the mob goes off the cliff

when things go wrong, a scapegoat is sacrificed

- rene girard (learned from peter thiel)

depending on who you copy, being deliberate, humans have enough variety and excellence in so many fields, that you can 8020 copy in a way, to a great life
will we mimetically fail by copying elon, all of us trying to build wealth with tech

you can copy a lot of humanity and be successful that way, but be careful that its actually a good idea, the source is just another person, but you could also get ideas from other things
